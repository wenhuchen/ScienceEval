{"question": "Differentiate between the monocots and dicots.", "solution": "The two classes of angiosperms, the monocotyledons and dicotyledons, differ in eight respects. First, the monocot embryo has one cotyledon (seed leaf) while the dicot has two. The cotyledon of the monocots functions generally in food absorption while that of the dicots can function both in absorption and storage. Second, the endosperm typically persists in the mature seed of the monocots, while it is usually absent from the mature seed of the dicots. Third, the leaves of the monocots have parallel veins and smooth edges; dicot leaves have net-like veins and lobed or indented edges. Fourth, cambium or meristematic cork and vascular tissue is usually present in the stems of dicots but absent in the monocots. Fifth, the vascular bundles of xylem and phloem are scattered throughout the stem of monocots. In the dicots they occur either as a single solid mass in the center of the stem or as a ring between the cortex and pith. Sixth, the flowering parts of monocots - petals, sepals, stamens, and pistils - exist in threes or multi-ples of three , whereas dicot floral parts usually occur in fours, fives or multiples thereof. Seventh, the monocots are mostly herbaceous plants while many dicots are woody plants. Finally, the roots of monocots are typically fibrous and adventitious (outgrowths of the stem) whereas the root system of dicots usually consist of one or more primary tap roots and numerous secondary roots.", "images": ["images/F08-0204_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F08-0204.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Monocots have one cotyledon, persistent endosperm in mature seed, parallel veins in leaves, no cambium in stems, scattered vascular bundles, floral parts in multiples of three, are mostly herbaceous, and have fibrous roots.

{"question": "A man with diabetes mellitus has a sudden fit of anger over a minor traffic accident, and lapses into a coma. Explain the physiological events leading to the coma and what should be done to bring him out of the coma.", "solution": "Diabetes mellitus is a disease which results from a hyposecretion of insulin. Insulin stimulates glu-cose uptake by all cells with the exception of brain cells. Hyposecretion of insulin reduces the cellular uptake of glucose, leading to an accumulation of glucose in the blood. The blood glucose may rise to such a level that a good deal of it cannot be reabsorbed by the kidney tubules. When this happens the level of glucose excreted into the urine increases tremendously. The osmotic force exerted by glucose in the urine retains water and prevents its reabsorption. Thus, the volume of water excreted is also abnormally high in people with diabetes. This loss of wa-ter, if sufficiently great, can ultimately reduce blood pres-sure to such an extent that there is a marked decrease in blood flow to the brain, resulting in coma and possibly death. In our specific example, coma is induced by the afore-mentioned means. Emotional stress stimulates the release of glucose from the liver through the action of epinephrine, thereby resulting in a rapid increase in blood glucose.In the case of a person with diabetes, this increased blood glucose results in a large amount of water loss, which in turn leads to a decreased blood pressure. Blood flow to the brain is reduced owing to the drop in blood pressure. Coma usually results as blood supply to the brain cells becomes insufficient. Insulin should be given as treatment for this comatose person. Insulin will stimulate glucose uptake, thereby reducing its level in the blood. Glucose concentration in the urine subsequently declines, and water loss is diminished. The pressure of the blood is thereby restored to normal. It is important to note that the dosage of insulin injected is critical. If an overdose of insulin is ad-ministered, the situation is equally fatal had no insulin been injected. This is because insulin cannot enter the brain, and hence the brain cells will not alter their rate of glucose uptake. Thus they are greatly dependent on the blood supply for glucose to maintain their energy metabolism. When too much insulin is given to the diabetic, his blood stream is essentially depleted of glucose units which have entered most of the body cells excepting the brain cells. Hence the brain will starve from an insuffi-cient supply of glucose, and its functions will break down. A coma is usually what follows.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F21-0537.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Insulin should be given as treatment for this comatose person."}

Given these data, calculate the change of entropy \u2206S, change of enthalpy \u2206H, and the change of energy \u2206E for the conversion of one mole of ice to liquid water at the normal melting point.", "solution": "The solution of this problem involves the ability to relate energy, free energy, entropy, and enthalpy. One must first calculate the change in entropy. You are told the entropies of both ice and water. The change in entropy is their difference or \u2206S =S_liq-S_solid= 59.94 - 37.95 = 21.99 J mol^-1 deg^-1 . To calculate the change in enthalpy at the melting point use the fact that \u2206G = 0 at the melting point of a substance. \u2206G = \u2206H -T_Mp\u2206S, where \u2206H = change in enthalpy,T_Mp= temperature of melting point in Kelvin and \u2206S = change in entropy. Since \u2206G = 0 at the melting point, \u2206H =T_Mp\u2206S. From the previous calculation, you know \u2206S.T_Mpis given. Thus, \u2206H = T\u2206S \u2206H = (273.15K) (21.99 J mol^-1 deg^-1) = 6010 J/mole. To calculate the \u2206E for the conversion of one mole of ice to liquid water at the normal melting point, employ the equation \u2206E = \u2206H - P\u2206V, where P = pressure, V = volume. \u2206H = 6010 J/mole. To determine P\u2206V, note that \u2206V isV_liq-V_solid. You are given the densities of ice and water. Recalling that density = mass/volume, and that the molecular weight (mass) of ice or water is 18.015 grams/mole, you have forV_liq: 18.015/.9998. ForV_solid, You have 18.015/.917.Therefore \u2206V =V_liq-V_solid= [(18.015 g/mole)/(.9998 g/cm^3)] - [(18.015 g/mole)/(.917 g/cm^3)] = - 1.63 cm^3 /mole = - .00163 liter/mole. Since one is asked to make these calculations for 1 mole of H_2 O, the change in volume, \u2206V, equals - .00163 liter. Because you are asked to calculate at the normal melting point, the pressure must be 1atm(by definition, the \"normal\" is considered to be under a pressure of one atm.) Therefore, P\u2206V = (1.00atm) (-0.00163 liter) = -0.00163 liter - atm. Since 1 liter -atmequals 101.3 J, P\u2206V is equal to (-0.00163 liter -atm) (101.3 J liter^-1 atm^-1) = - 0.1651 J.

{"question": "When mixed at 700\\textdegreeK, H_2(g) and I_2 (g) react to produce HI(g). The reaction is first order in H_2 and first order in I_2.

What would be the probable effect on this number if each of the following changes were made in the initial conditions? (a) Use two moles of H_2 instead of one. (b) Use two moles of I_2 instead of one. (c) Use a 2-liter box. (d) Raise the temperature to 750\\textdegreeK. (e) Add a platinum catalyst, (f) Add enough neon gas to double the initial pressure.", "solution": "When a reaction is said to be first order in a particular reactant, it means that the rate of the re-action is proportional to the concentration of that re-actant. Thus, for this reaction the rate law can be written Rate = k [H_2][I_2], where k is the rate constant and [ ] indicates concentration. When 1 mole of each H_2 and I_2 are used, one can solve for the rate by substituting these values into the rate law. Rate = k (1)(1) = 1k Solving for the rate when [H_2] is 2 moles Rate = k[2][1] = 2k Thus, when the concentration of H_2 is doubled the rate is doubled. (b)One can solve for the rate when [I_2] = 2 moles by substituting into the rate law. Rate = k(1) (2) = 2 k Thus when [I_2] doubled the rate is also doubled. (c)Boyle's law states that the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume. Thus, when this reaction which originally takes place in a 1-liter box is moved to a 2- liter box, the pressure of the reactants is halved. Solving for the rate: Rate = k (1/2) (1/2) = 1/4 kor.25 k. Thus, for this reaction, when the pressure of the reactants is halved, the rate is 1/4 of the original rate. (d)Product is formed when an atom of H collides with an atom of I, thus the rate of the reaction will increase with a rise in temperature because the atoms will move more quickly creating a greater chance for collisions. (e)By definition, a catalyst will increase the rate of the reaction by lowering the amount of energy needed for the reaction to proceed. (f)When neon gas is added to increase the pressure in the 1-liter box, the rate of the reaction does not change because the concentrations of H2and I_2 remain unchanged. When the pressure in the system is doubled by decreasing the volume by 1/2 the rate is increased because the con-centrations of H_2 and I_2 are increased. If one starts out with one mole per liter of H_2 at 1 atm and then increases the pressure to 2 atm by adding neon, the con-centration of H_2 is still 1 mole per liter. When the pressure in a container containing 1 mole per liter of H_2 is increased from 1 to 2 atm by halving the volume of the container, the concentration of H_2 is now 1 mole per 1/2 liter or 2 moles per liter.

The two pairs of long membranous wings are held permanent-ly at right angles to the body. They have chewing mouth-parts and large compound eyes. Immature forms of these insects (nymphs) are aquatic (fresh water). Other winged insects can fold their wings back over the body when they are not flying.

{"question": "Define the terms haploid, dipolid, gamete, zygote, sporophyte and gametophyte.", "solution": "These terms refer to the life cycle and reproductive processes of algae, fungi, and higher plants. The chromosome number is termed haploid or diploid. A haploid organism is one which possesses a single complete set of chromosomes while a diploid organism has two sets of chromosomes. A gamete is a cell specialized for sexual repro-duction, and is always haploid. Two gametes fuse to form a diploid cell, which may give rise to a new multi-cellular individual via mitotic division, or which may itself undergo meiosis to form new haploid cells. The diploid cell that results when two gametes fuse is termed a zygote. The zygote is always diploid and is always a single cell. Life cycles of algae and fungi show much more variability than life cycles of higher plants and animals. The different species within a phylum often have very different life cycles, and most algae and fungi are capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction occurs when two haploid gametes fuse to form a zygote. Asexual reproduction occurs by frag-mentation, with each fragment growing into a new plant or thallus. Asexual reproduction also involves mitotic division of a single cell of a thallus to produce daughter cells which are released from the parent thallus to grow into new algae or fungi. Daughter cells which are motile and specialized for asexual reproduction are termed zoospores. In certain species, alternation of generations occurs. This type of life cycle includes both a multi-cellular haploid plant and a multicellular diploid plant, and both sexual and asexual reproduction. In algae, fungi, and most other lower plant forms, the dominant generation is the haploid one, and the reverse is true in the higher plants. Ulva (sea lettuce) , a green alga, and Ectocarpus (a brown alga) are representative of organisms which show alternation of generations. The entire life cycle can be summarized as follows: Haploid zoospores (stage 1) divide mitotically to produce a haploid multicellular thallus (stage 2). These haploid thalli may reproduce asexually by means of zoospores or sexually by means of gametes (stage 3). Gametes fuse to produce a diploid zygote (stage 4). The zygote divides mitotically to produce a diploid multi-cellular thallus (stage 5). Certain reproductive cells of the diploid thallus divide by meiosis to produce zoospores (stage 1). The zoospores are released, and begin the cycle anew. The haploid multicellular stage is called a gametophyte because it is a plant that produces gametes. The diploid multicellular stage is called a sporophyte because it is a plant that produces spores.", "images": ["images/F06-0172_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F06-0172.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "A haploid organism possesses a single complete set of chromosomes while a diploid organism has two sets of chromosomes.

{"question": "A student wanted to produce a sample of lactic acid. He carried out the following synthesis: CH_3CH_2CO_2H \\rightarrow CH_3CHCICO_2H \\rightarrow CH_3CHOHCO_2H. He obtained a product that appeared to be lactic acid, and yet, it was optically inactive. Does this mean the product was not truly lactic acid?", "solution": "A carbon atom that has four different atoms or groups attached to it is termed an asymmetric carbon atom or a chiral center. These four groups can give two spatial arrangements, whose relationship to each other is that of an object and its mirror image. For example, see the accompanying figure. The two arrangements are not identi-cal, because they are not superimposable. In such cases, these molecules,i.e. those which differ only in the positioning of groups around asymmetric carbon atoms, are called optical isomers. Such isomers can rotate plane polarized light. Plane polarized light vibrates in only one plane. When substances can rotate plane polarized light, they are optically active. Each of the two optical isomers rotates the light in a different direction. The dextrorotary isomer rotates it to the right, while the levorotatory rotates it to the left. If both isomers are present in equal amounts, the light will not be rotated at all. For one rotates it to the left and the other rotates it to the right, which means there is a cancellation of the rotations. When plane-polarized light is not rotated, the solution is optically inactive. With this information, one can now answer the question. The student formed CH_3CHOHCO_2H, which he believed was lactic acid. The solution was optically inactive, and yet, it is known that lactic acid is optically active. The only possible explanation for this is that the student formed equal amounts of the two possible optical isomers. As mentioned, this results in optical inactivity. There is every reason to believe that formed in equal amounts. The star (\\textasteriskcentered) indicates the asymmetric carbon. Thus, the student did form lactic acid.

{"question": "From which group of organisms did the amphibians develop? What two characteristics of the amphibian's ancestors were preadaptations for life on land?", "solution": "It is believed that the lobe-finned fish were the ancestors of the land vertebrates. This group was thought to be extinct for about 75 million years. In 1939, however, a living lobe-finned fish of the superorder Crossopterygii, the coelacanth, was caught by a commercial fisherman from waters off the coast of South Africa. Since that time, many more of these fish have been caught. The coelacanths are not the particular lobe- finned fish thought to be the ancestors of land vertebrates, but they resemble those ancestral forms in many ways. In addition to the presence of lungs used for breathing, these fish had another important preadaptation for life on land - the large fleshy bases of their paired pectoral and pelvic fins. These fleshy bases had a bony support through them which allowed for greater support. It is these supportive bones which later form the leg bones of the amphibians. At times, especially during droughts, lobe-finned fish probably used these leg-like fins to pull themselves onto sand bars and mudflats. They may even have managed to crawl to a new pond or stream when the one they previously occupied had dried up. During ancestral times, before the vertebrates came onto land, the land was already filled with an abundance of plant life. Now, should any animal have the ability to survive on land, that animal would have a whole new range of habitats open to it without competition. Any lobe-finned fish that had appendages slightly better suited for land locomotion than those of its companions would have been able to exploit these habitats more fully. Through selection pressure exerted over millions of years, the fins of these first vertebrates to walk, or crawl, on land would slowly have evolved into legs. Thus, over a period of time, with a host of other adaptations for life on land evolving at the same time (e.g., atmospheric changes), one group of ancient lobe-finned fishes must have given rise to the first amphibians.", "images": ["images/F13-0334_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F13-0334.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The amphibians developed from the lobe-finned fish.

This is done by dividing the weight present by the molecular weight no. of moles = (no. of grams) / (MW) For Ti : (MW = 47.9) no. of moles = (1.00g) / (47.9g/mole) = 2.09 \u00d7 10^-2 moles.

The weight of the boy W_b and the weight of the preserver W_p acting downward are just balanced by the buoyant force of the preserver B_p and the buoyant force of the boy B_b. B_b + B_p = W_b + W_p(1) B_b and B_p are equal to the weight of fluid displaced by the boy and the preserver respectively. Hence B_p = Mg where M is the mass of the water displaced by the boy.

{"question": "What are the roles of coenzyme A in metabolism ?", "solution": "Coenzyme A is a large, complex organic molecule involved in a number of key reactions in the cell. The functions of coenzyme A are several. In glycolysis, glucose is converted to pyruvate. To enter the Krebs acid cycle (also known as the tricarboxylic acid, or TCA cycle and the citric acid cycle) , pyruvate must be con-verted to another form; such a conversion first involves decarboxylation of pyruvate (loss of carbon dioxide), then a reaction with coenzyme A, and finally, a dehydrogenation re-action, to yield acetyl coenzyme A. The reactions are rep-resented as follows: The acetate group is bonded to the coenzyme A molecule via a high energy bond. The energy of this bond in acetyl coenzyme A is utilized to transfer the acetyl group to oxaloacetic acid, the first reaction of the TCA cycle. Coenzyme A is also involved in a reaction farther along in the cycle. An intermediate (derived from \\alpha- Ketoglutarate) combines with coenzyme A to yield succinyl coenzyme A. The bond connecting coenzyme A to succinate is also of high energy. The energy in this bond is converted to an energy-rich phosphate bond,\\simP, through the addition of an inorganic \\sim phosphate. The phosphate group is subsequently transfered to GDP to produce GTP and free succinate. The reactions are diagrammed below: Coenzyme A is also utilized in fatty acid oxidation. The metabolism of a fatty acid initially involves its activation by ATP and coenzyme A to fatty acyl coenzyme A.

{"question": "For the block and tackle shown in the figure (a) find the displacement ratio. (b) What force, F, must be exerted on the free end of the rope to lift a 200 lb load?", "solution": "(a) When F\\ding{217} pulls down the rope by an amount L, pulley 2 moves up by (1/2)L (as shown in the figure) since the shortening of the rope is shared by the two segments of rope that hold the pulley. Therefore, the ratio of the displacement of load to the displacement of the rope is [(1/2)L]/L = (1/2). (b) From the figure, we see that the load is held up by a force 2T\\ding{217} where T\\ding{217} is the tension in the rope.

{"question": "Howarethe type of muscle tissues differentiated?", "solution": "The cells of muscle tissue have great capacity for contraction. Muscles are able to perform work by the summed contractions of their individualcells. The individual muscle cells are usually elongate, cylindricalor spindle-shaped cells that are bound together into sheets or bundlesby connective tissue. Three principal types of muscle tissue are found in vertebrates. Skeletal or striated muscle is responsible for most voluntary movements. Smooth muscle is involved in most involuntary movements of internal organs, such as the stomach. Cardiac muscle is the tissue of which much ofthe heart wall is composed; it is also involuntary. Most skeletal muscle, as the name implies, is attached to the bones ofthe body, and its contraction is responsible for the movements of parts ofthe skeleton. Skeletal muscle contraction is also involved in other activitiesof the body, such as the voluntary release of urine and feces. Thus the movements produced by skeletal muscle are primarily involved withinteractions between the body and the external environment. Skeletal muscle reveals a striated appearance, and is therefore alsoreferred to as striated muscle. These striations are actually due to the regulararrangement of thick and thinmyofilamentsin individual muscle fibercells. Skeletal muscle is an exception to the common observation thateach cell contains only one nucleus: each skeletal fiber cell is multinucleated: it has many nuclei. Skeletal muscle can contractcery rapidlybut cannot remain contracted; the fibers must relax before the next contrac-tioncan occur. Smooth muscle can be classified as visceral smooth muscle. It is foundin the walls of hollow visceral or-gans, such as the uterus, urinary bladder, bronchioles and much of the gastrointestinal tract. Vascular smoothmuscle refers to that smooth muscle in the walls of blood vessels. Unlike skeletal muscle cells that are cylindrical, multinucleate, and striated, smooth muscle cells are spin-dle-shaped,uninucleate, and lack striations. This lack of striations accounts for its smooth appearance. They havea slower speed of contraction, but can remain contracted for a longer periodof time than the striated muscle cells. Cardiac muscle has properties similar to those of both skeletal and smoothmuscles. Like skeletal muscle cells, cardiac muscle cells are striated. Like smooth muscle fibers, cardiac muscle fibers are uninucleatedand are designed for endured contraction rather than speedy orstrong contraction. Cardiac and smooth muscles are not voluntarily controlledbut have spontaneous activities, and are regulated by the autonomicnervous system. The skeletal muscle, being voluntary, is controlledby the somatic nervous system.

{"question": "Consider the experimental apparatus, illustrated in figure A which is used to measure the deflection of an electron. The source of electrons is a heated filament and the detector consists of a screen painted with a material which phosphoresces when struck by energetic particles. The magnetic field is confined to the spherical region. During a particular run of this experiment, an electron enters the magnetic field at a distance of 30 cm away from the detecting screen and travels 25 cm after leaving the field. If the strength of the magnetic field is 0.18 g/coulomb-sec and the beam deflection on the screen is 4.0 mm, what is the velocity of the electrons in the beam?", "solution": "We are looking for a relationship between the magnetic field strength H, the deflection of the electron and the electron velocity v. Such a relationship is pro-vided by the equation of motion of an electron in a magnetic field, v = Her/m, where e is the electronic charge (e = 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 coulomb), r is the radius of curvature, H is the strength of the magnetic field, and m is the electron mass (m = 9.11 \u00d7 10^28 g). In order to apply this equation to solve for v, we must first determine r. In the following discussion to determine r, we will make reference to figure B (which is not drawn to scale for reasons of clarity). In the problem, we are given that the distance from the point at which the electron beam leaves the field to the deflecting screen is 25 cm. The point at which the electron leaves the field is D. H and D lie on the same vertical line, hence the distance from D to the screen is the same as the distance from H to the screen, or HJ = 25 cm. Since the electron de-flection is small, we can assume that the path of the electron is not far from the path the electron would have in the absence of a field. Hence, we can assume that HI is much smaller than CI and HJ, and that FG is much smaller than FB and BG. If we make this assumption that HI is negligible, then IJ = HJ - HI \\cong HJ = 25 cm. The distance from the point at which the electron enters the field (point C) to the screen is 30 cm, or CJ = 30 cm. Then Cl = CJ - IJ = 30 cm - 25 cm = 5 cm. Denoting the center of the circle containing the magnetic field by G, we have CG = GI = (1/2)CI = 5 cm/2 = 2.5 cm. Using our assumption on the smallness of HI, we obtain GH = GI - HI \\cong GI = 2.5 cm. In summary, so far we have obtained the following distances: CG = GI \\cong GH = 2.5 cm,IJ \\cong HJ = 25 cm. The strategy from this point on will be as follows. We will use the similarity of triangle GJE and triangle GHD to determine HD. Then, using the similarity of tri-angle CHD and triangle CFB, we will obtain the ratio BF/CF, and from this, the radius of curvature, r. There is a theorem from elementary plane geometry which states that when a triangle is cut by a line parallel to one of its sides, the two resulting tri-angles are similar. Since HD and JE are both drawn vertically, and are therefore parallel, triangle GJE is similar to triangle GHD, Hence [(GH)/(GJ)] = [(HD)/(JE)]or HD = JE \u00d7 [(GH)/(GJ)] = 4 mm \u00d7 [(2.5 cm)/(27.5 cm)] = 0.4 cm \u00d7 [(2.5 cm)/(27.5 cm)] = 0.036 cm. Next we note that, using the theorems of plane geometry, it can be shown that triangle CHD is similar to CGB. Then [(HD)/(CG)] = [(CD)/(BG)] Because r = BG, we solve this ratio for BG. We have al-ready determined HD and CG and can find CD by using the Pyhthagorean Theorem, thus, we can find BG. Solving for CD: CD^2 = CH^2 + HD^2 = (5.0 cm)^2 + (0.036 cm)^2 = 25.001 cm^2; CD = 5.00 cm. Solving for BG; BG = [(CD \\textbullet CG)/(HD)] = [(5.0 cm) (2.5 cm)] / (0.036 cm) = 347.2cm. We can now substitute r into the equation of motion of an electron in a magnetic field. We thus obtain the electron velocity, v = (Her/m) = [(0.18 g/coulomb-sec \u00d7 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 coulomb \u00d7 347.2 cm)] /(9.11 \u00d7 10^-28 g)] = [(1.10 \u00d7 101 0cm/sec)].", "images": ["images/E18-0664_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E18-0664.htm", "image_question": true, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "1.10 \u00d7 101 0cm/sec"}

This phenomenon is called the Doppler effect and can be determined. The wavelength \\lambda of a wave can be defined as \\lambda = distance / no. of waves The no. of waves that a source of frequencyv_Semits in time t is justv_St. If the medium permits the waves to travel at velocity v then the distance they cover in time t due to their own motion isvt. Since the source is also moving toward the listener at velocityv_Sand covers a distancev_St, this means that the waves have a distancevt-v_Stto be spread out in.

{"question": "In. the figure, suppose that the block weighs 20 lb., that the tension T can be increased to 8 lb. before the block starts to slide, and that a force of 4 lb. will keep the block moving at constant speed once it has been set in motion, (a) Find the coefficients of static and kinetic friction, (b) What is the frictional force if the block is at rest on the surface and a horizontal force of 5 lb. is exerted on it?", "solution": "a) There are 2 forces of friction which can act on a body. These are the forces of kinetic and static friction. If a body, such as that in the figure, is initially at rest and we begin pulling on it with a variable force T, the block will remain at rest. This means that no matter what force T we apply to the body, the frictional force f always balances it. However, at some value of T, the frictional force no longer balances it, and the block begins translating, We may describe this static frictional force by f_s \\leq\\mu_sN(1) where \\mu_s is the coefficient of static friction and N is the normal force of the table on the block. (The equality holds when the block begins translating). Once the block begins translating, the static frictional force stops acting and the kinetic frictional force takes over. This force is f_k = \\mu_kN(2) It is also found that f_k < fs max, and that once the block starts moving, we may reduce T and the block will still move. Applying the Second Law to the block of mass m N - mg = ma_y T - f = ma_x Here a_x and a_y are the x and y components of the block's acceleration. Because the block coesn't leave the surface of the table, a_y = 0. Hence N = mg(3) T - f = ma_x(4) The block is initially at rest, and just begins to slip when T = 8 lb. If we examine the block just before it moves, a_x = 0, and f is the maximum force of static friction. Then, using (1) T - fs max= 0 T= \\mu_sN 8 lb= \\mu_sN Using (3)\\mu_s= (8 lb)/mg = (8 lb)/(20 lb) = .4 Once translation at constant velocity begins, T = 4 lb, a_x = 0 and f in (4) is f_k = \\mu_kN.

To find the energy values of theeigenstatesof hydrogen, consider theSchroedingerequation expressed in spherical co-ordinates . \\psi(r, \\texttheta, \\textphi) = R (r) y (\\texttheta, \\textphi). In general, the total energy of the hydrogen electron is due to its angular momentum (rotation with radius r), its linear momentum along the variable radius r, and its potential energy due only to its distance r from the nucleus. TheSchroedingerequation for the radial part R(r) of the wavefunctioncan be obtained at once as follows. The angu-lar momentum equals L =mvr. The rotational energy of the particle at radius r is (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2)m[(L/mr)]^2 = (L^2/2mr^2). Rotational energy, the angular motion of the particle, is related to the y(\\texttheta, \\textphi) part of thewavefunction. The angular momentum of the electron in a stable state around the nucleus (energyeigenstate) is quantized as L^2 = l (l + 1)h^2l = 0,1,2,... Wherehis Planck's constant divided by 2\\pi. As far as the radial motion along r is concerned, the contribution of the rotational motion to the total energy of the particle, [{L(L + 1)h^2}/2mr^2] , depends only on the radial position r. Potential energy can be viewed as any energy which de-pends on a distance r and reduces to zero at infinite dis-tance. This permits us to consider the energy due to rota-tion as a form of potential energy. Hence, the one- dimensional radial motion takes place in an effective potential (important since it is expressed in terms of only one variable r). U (r) = [L(L + 1)h^2)/2m_er^2] + v (r)(1) where V(r) is the electrostatic potential. The radial part of theSchroedingerequation is given by - (h^2/2m_e) (1/r^2) (d/dr)(r^2 R') + U (r) R (r) = ER (r)(2) where E is the total energy (eigenvalue) corresponding to an orbit (eigenstate) of radius r and R' = [{dr(r)}/dr]. For the lowest energy states, let l equal zero. Also, for an electron a distance r from a nucleus of charge Ze, the potential energy is U (r) = [(-KZe^2)/r] = (-Ke^2/r)(3) where K is the Coulomb constant and Z = 1 for hydrogen. We therefore have (-h^2/2m_e) (1/r^2) (d/dr)(r^2R') - (Ke^2/r)R = ER.(4) Let\\lambda^2 = (-2m_eE/h^2).(5) We assume \\lambda^2 is positive since the energy E must be negative if the electron is bound to the nucleus. Multiplying (4) by \\lambda^2/E we have (1/r^2) (d/dr)(r^2R') + [(2m_eKe^2)/h^2] (R/r) = \\lambda^2R.(6) A solution of Eq. (6) has to approach zero as r approaches \\infty since the energy is zero at infinite distance. Rewriting the equation, R\\textquotedblright + [(2R/r) + {(2m_eKe^2)/h^2} (R/r)] = \\lambda^2R.(7) For large r, the terms in parentheses are insignificant and we have R\" = \\lambda^2R(8) which is satisfied by R \\approx e-\\lambdar(9) which goes to zero when r, the distance of the electron from the nucleus, is infinite. This solution will be true for all r if the terms in parentheses in (7) cancel each other. To find the value of \\lambda which makes this true, we set these terms equal to zero. (2R'/r) + [(2m_eKe^2)/h^2] (R/r) = 0. We know that R' = -\\lambdae^-\\lambdar= -\\lambdaR. Therefore we have (-2\\lambdaR/r) + [(2m_eKe^2)/h^2] (R/r) = 0(10) and \\lambda = [(m_eKe^2)/h^2] = (1/0.529 A)(11) sinceh^2/m_eKe2 \\approx 0.529 A is the Bohr radius. Therefore this value of \\lambda corresponds to the ground energy level (n = 1). This minimum energy is found from (5) E_1 = (-h^2\\lambda^2/2m_e) = - 13.6eV.

{"question": "It is easy to understand how selfish behavior can be explained by natural selection. But how can one account for altruism?", "solution": "Selfish behavior is exemplified in the formation of dominance hierarchies. The high-ranking animals eat before the other animals when food is scarce and take preference in the selection of mates and resting places. Consequently, these individuals are generally healthier, live longer and reproduce more frequently. Natural selection favors these strong animals, in that they produce more offspring having their superior traits. Selfish behavior is expected to be transferred to future generations since it leads to the more successful survival of the animal. Altruism is self-sacrificial behavior that benefits other members in a group. An altruistic animal reduces its own fitness, and therefore its chances of survival and reproduction, in order to increase the success of another animal or of the group as a whole. For example, a male baboon remains to fight a leopard while the troop escapes. Natural selection would not favor the continuation of this costly behavior since those who do show it are less likely to survive and reproduce. One would therefore expect the genes for altruism to be lost, but they are not. The reason for this lies in the fact that the male baboon - only risks its life for baboons in his own troop, not for baboons in other troops. His behavior therefore benefits only those baboons related to itself; these baboons probably share common genes, among which are those for altruistic behavior. The al-truistic behavior thus preserves the genes in the other members that are shared with the altruistic member by common descent. For the altruistic genes to be favored in natural selection, the benefit that the related members receive must outweigh the loss of the altruistic animal. Although the baboon might die and lose its ability to pass on its genes, the baboon's brother can compensate for the loss. To do so, it must have more than twice as many offspring as a result of its brother's altruistic behavior. (Since about 1/2 of the genes of a given animal are shared by its brother or sister.) Similarly, since first cousins share 1/4 of their genes, on the average, compensation would involve quadrupling the survivor's offspring. Altruism directed at a variety of relatives, from offspring to cousins, results in a summation of the benefits so that the altruistic gene(s) may be preserved and the related behavior may evolve. Thus, the existence of altruism can be accounted for by natural selection. To demonstrate the compensation by a relative for the loss of an altruistic relative, we will assume that altruism is determined by one allele, A. If one offspring of F_1 generation dies, its brother can compensate by doubling its offspring, (F_2). This will double the frequency of A in F_2 (2 \u00d7 1/4) to give 1/2, the frequency that A would have had in F_1 if the brother had not died. Similarly, if one altruistic offspring in the F_2 generation dies, its cousin (also in F_2) can compensate by quadrupling its offspring, F_3. Four times the frequency of A in F_3 (4 \u00d7 1/8) gives 1/2, which would be the frequency of A in F_1 if the cousin had not died. It is important to note that compensation must always be referred back to the F_1 generation, since that is the only way to prevent a loss of the altruistic gene.", "images": ["images/F31-0821_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F31-0821.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Altruism can be accounted for by natural selection as the altruistic behavior preserves the genes in the other members that are shared with the altruistic member by common descent.

How would one expect the strength of the bond to be affected by each of the following changes: (a) Doubling the charge on A, (b) Simultaneously doubling the charge on A and B, (c) Doubling the radius of B, and (d) Simultaneously doubling the radius of A and B?", "solution": "When two ions come together to form an ionic bond, energy is released. The more energy released, the stronger the ionic bond. The amount of energy released is determined by the equation E = 1.44 (q_1q_2 / r) where E = energy in electron volts, q_1 = charge on the positive ion, q_2 = charge on the negative ion, and r = the distance between the nuclear centers. If one changes one parameter, another must adjust to maintain this e-quality. Solving: (a) If the charge on A, the positive ion, is doubled, the energy released is doubled. That is, 2E = 1.44 [(2q_1q_2)/ r] is equivalent to E = [(1.44 q_1q_2) / r]. If E is doubled, the strength of the chemical bond is doubled. (b) Using a similar line of reasoning, it is found that if one doubles both the positive and negative charges, four times E is released. The strength of the bond is, thus, 4 times as great as the original bond. (c) If one increases the radius of the ions then, the distance between their nuclei must also increase. To maintain the equality, E must decrease because r is inverselypropotionalto E. Therefore, the bond strength decreases. When the ionic radius of one ion is doubled, E is halved. (d) Both radii are doubled. E is diminished by a factor of 4 and the strength of the bond is decreased by a factor of 4.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E17-0618.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "(a) Bond strength is doubled, (b) Bond strength is 4 times as great, (c) Bond strength decreases, (d) Bond strength is decreased by a factor of 4"}
{"question": "When a Kundt's tube contains air, the distance between several nodes is 25 cm. When the air is pumped out and replaced by a gas, the distance between the same number of nodes is 35 cm. The velocity of sound in air is 340 m \\bullet s^-1. What is the velocity of sound in the gas?", "solution": "A Kundt's tube (see the figure) is a glass tube with sawdust spread over its interior. A piston P is set into longitudinal vibration and the wall W moved until a standing wave pattern of nodes and antinodes is set up within the tube. The sawdust will accumulate at all the nodal points, for these are the points of the wave for which there is no vibration of the gas. By measuring the distance d between the nodes, we may find the velocity of sound of the gas in the tube. Let the number of nodes involved be 2n + 1. There are 2n intervals between these 2n + 1 nodes, and the total distance thus corresponds to 2n half-wavelengths, or to n full wavelengths. The frequency of the emitted sound is the same in both cases, for it depends only on the frequency of the vibra-ting membrane which is causing the standing wave within the Kundt's tube. Thus c_A = f\\lambda_A and c_G = f\\lambda_G. Since there are, in the case of the air filled tube, n wavelengths in 25 cm of space, then the number of centi-meters of space one wavelength will contain is found by the following proportion. (25 cm / n wavelength) = (x cm / 1 wavelength) = \\lambda_A Similarly for the case of the gas filled tube, (35 cm / n wavelength) = (x cm / 1 wavelength) = \\lambda_G Thus c_G / c_A = \\lambda_G / \\lambda_A = [(35/n) cm] / [(25/n) cm] = 7/5. \\therefore c_G = (7/5) \u00d7 340 m \\bullet s^-1 = 476 m \\bullet s^-1.

(This is only about 0.1 percent of the total mass-energy of a uranium nucleus; the other 99.9 percent remains in the masses of the neutrons and protons and is therefore not available for conversion into kinetic energy.) In 1kg of U^235, there are approximately 2.5 \u00d7 10^24 atoms.

{"question": "What factors affect the rate of transpiration?", "solution": "A number of different factors affect the rate of transpiration. The most important of these is temperature. Because temperature is a measurement of the average molecular kinetic energy, a high temperature heating up the plant body will provide the water molecules within the leaves with increased internal energy, and many of them may soon gainadequate kinetic energy to enter the gaseous phase and escape into the atmosphere . The higher the temperature rises, the greater will be the rate of transpiration, all other factors remaining constant. Plants of the desert, thus , must adapt some mechanisms to slow down water loss due to rapid evapo-ration by the hot desert air. Humidity is a second important factor. Water is lost much more slowly into air already laden with water vapor. This is why plants growing in shady forests, where the humidity is generally high, typically spread large luxuriant leaf surfaces since their chief problem is getting enough sunlight , not losing water. In contrast, plants of grasslands or other exposed areas often have narrow leaves and relatively little total leaf surface , since they are able to get sufficient light but are constantly in danger of excessive water loss. Air currents also affect the rate of transpiration. Wind blows away the water vapor from leaf surfaces, allowing more vapor molecules to escape from the leaf surface. If the air is humid, wind may actually decrease the transpiration rate by cooling the leaf, but if the breeze is dry, evaporation is increased and the trans-piration rate is greatly enhanced. Leaves of plants growing in windy, exposed areas are often hairy. These hairs are believed to protect the leaf surface from wind action by trapping a layer of air saturated with water vapor over the surface of the leaf. As before , humid air reduces the rate of evaporation, thus preventing excessive loss of water.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F10-0257.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Temperature, humidity, and air currents"}

{"question": "Discuss the basic features of the molluscan body. How do they differ in the several classes of mollusks ?", "solution": "The phylum Mollusca is the second largest in the animal kingdom. Snails, clams, oysters, slugs, squids, and octopuses are among the best known molluscs. The adult body plan is remarkably different from that of any other group of invertebrates. The soft body consists of three principal parts: (1) a large ventral muscular foot which can be extruded from the shell (if a shell is present) and functions in locomotion; (2) a visceral mass above the foot, containing most of the organs of the body; and (3) a mantle, a heavy fold of tissue that covers the visceral mass. In most species, the mantle contains glands that secrete a shell. The mantle often projects over the edges of the foot and overhangs the sides of the visceral mass, thus enclosing a mantle cavity, in which gills frequently lie. The chitons, members of the class Amphineura, have an ovoid bilaterally symmetrical body with an anterior mouth and posterior anus. They have paired excretory organs, nerves, gonads, and gills. The shell consists of eight dorsal plates. Class Gastropoda is a large class, containing the snails, slugs and their relatives. Most gastropods have a coiled shell; however, in some species, coiling is minimal, and in others, the shell has been lost. The body plan of the adult gastropods is not symmetrical. During develop-ment, two rotations of the body occur, so that the anus comes to lie dorsal to the head in the anterior part of the body. The organs on one side of the body atrophy, so that the adult has one heart, one kidney, one gonad, and one gill. This embryonic twisting, called torsion, occurs in all gastropods, including those with a flat shell, slugs and other species without a shell Class Pelecypoda or Bivalvia contains the bivalves. These mollusks have two hinged shells. Scallops, clams, mussels, and oysters are well known bivalves. These animals have well-developed muscles for opening and clos-ing the shells. These animals also have a muscular siphon for the intake and output of water. The nautilus squid, and octopus are members of the class cephalopoda. Cephalopod means head-foot, and in these molluscs the foot is fused with the head. In squids and octopuses, the foot is divided into ten or eight tentacles, and the shell is greatly reduced or absent.

{"question": "What is the difference between multiprogramming and time-- sharing?", "solution": "Multiprogramming involves more efficient utilization of CPU and I/O devices. This is accomplished by allowing mul-tiple programs that are ready for execution to reside in primary memory. While one program is doing something unrelated to CPU, such as input-output, another one may be running on CPU. This, a multi-programmed operating system, keeps track of programs (ac-tually internally defined program segments called processes or tasks), by assigning and releasing the CPU as a resource. When a program needs to do I/O it is suspended, and another program is assigned the CPU. When the suspended program finishes input- output, it is readied for another CPU assignment. This way, both the I/O devices and CPU are kept busy. Therefore, the efficiency and utilization of resources is higher. A side benefit of multi-programming, as opposed to say loading one program at a time and then running it, is better utilization of the primary memory since it tends to be occupied more. The aim of time-sharing is not efficiency or better re-source usage, but rather, it is being able to support more than one user at a time. Thus, a multi-user operating system uses time-sharing to support as many users as possible (without se-vere performance degradation). First, note that time-sharing requires multiprogramming and not the other way around. With time-sharing, in addition to the multiprogramming where a pro-cess is suspended when, say, it needs to do input-output; each process is suspended regularly upon completion of its time quota (or slice) . The time quota is small, typically in milliseconds, but not so small as to cause too much overhead in suspending and readying processes. It is then possible for multiple users (and their programs) to share the CPU by taking turns at quick time intervals in round robin fashion. Although the CPU operates sequentially by doing only one thing at a time (e.g. run this or that program at a given instant), the time slice is so small as to make the users feel as if they are simultaneously using the CPU. The idea of time-sharing then leads to the idea of \"virtual machine.\" If, on the average, there are ten users on a fast CPU, each user can be regarded as running his/her programs on a com-puter (machine) ten times slower. Note that in a time- sharing system, how fast a program completes depends upon how many users are using the computer at the time. This may not be acceptable in situations where a program must complete within a specified period of real time. An example is the capture of data sent from a remote sensor device.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G01-0020.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Multiprogramming involves more efficient utilization of CPU and I/O devices by allowing multiple programs ready for execution to reside in primary memory.

{"question": "How would you explain the secondary response to antigens on the basis of the clonal selection theory?", "solution": "When an antigen is first injected into an animal, only a small number of lymphocytes become trans-formed into plasma cells. The amount of antibodies produced rises slowly to a low peak and then decreases. This is termed the primary response. If a second injec-tion of the same antigen occurs some weeks later, a much more vigorous response is induced. Not only is the amount of antibodies much greater than in the primary response, but their production is much more rapid (see Fig.). Further injections will result in the maximum amount of antibody that can be produced. Primary and secondary responses of antibody formation can be explained on the basis of the clonal selection theory. When an antigen first comes in contact with its corresponding lymphocyte, it stimulates the lymphocyte to divide and differentiate into plasma cells (or lymphoblasts). The antibodies Of these cells interact with the antigen to form complexes which are engulfed and destroyed by macrophages. Some days after the primary response, these plasma cells (or lymphoblasts) eventually die. However, the antigen caused production of many more copies of the originally stimulated small lymphocytes. It is thought that these lymphocytes, called memory cells, arise from division of the originally stimulated cells without concomitant dif-ferentiation into plasma cells (lymphoblasts).

{"question": "A uniform, spherical bowling ball is projected without initial rotation along a horizontal bowling alley. How far will the ball skid along the alley before it begins to roll without slipping? Assume that the ball does not bounce. (See figure).", "solution": "The ball is projected along the alley at point A. When it hits the alley at point B, the ball will roll and slip. At point C, the ball has begun to roll without slipping. In order to find the distance at which skidding (or slipping) stops, we must find the acceleration of the ball, and then solve for its position. Applying Newton's Second Law to the horizontal direction of motion of the ball, we obtain ma_x = - f(1) where a_x is the horizontal acceleration of the ball of mass m. Note that we take a_x to be positive in the positive x-direction. Applying the Second Law to the vertical direction ma_y = N - mg But a_y , the y acceleration of the ball, is zero since the ball doesn't bounce.

The equation of theautoprotolysiscan be written NH_3 + NH_3 \\rightleftarrows NH+_4 + NH^-_2 or (i) 2NH_3 \\rightleftarrows NH+_4 + NH^-_2 . To find the constant expression, consider the equilibrium con-stant expression for the reaction: K = [{(NH+_4) (NH-_2)}/{(NH_3)^2}] . Note, though, that the concentration of NH_3 in pureamnoniais always constant. By analogy with theautoprotolysisof water (where the K_W expression is written [OH^-] [H_3O^+] - without [H_2O]^2 in the denominator), the constant expression for theautoprotolysisof NH_3 is (ii) K_NH3 = [NH+_4] [NH-_2] . To find the number of molecules of ammonia ionized in 1 mole of ammonia, use the equation K = [{(NH+_4) (NH-_2)}/{(NH_3)^2}] . Let x be the number of moles of ammonia ionized. Then the NH_3 remainingnonionizedis 1-x moles. Since each 2 ammonia molecules must ionize to produce one NH+_4 and one NH-_2 , the number of NH+_4 = number of NH^-_2 = (x/2). Let V be the volume of one mole of ammonia. The concentration of NH^+_4 and NH-_2 can be rewritten as [(x/2)/V], and the concentration ofnonionizedNH_3 is [(1 - x)/V] .

The first thing to determine is how many moles of chlorine will be produced. The volume can be determined using the fact that each mole, at STP, occupies 22.4 l.

{"question": "Estimate the minimum voltage needed to excite K radiation from an x-ray tube with a tungsten target, and calculate the wavelength of the K_\\alpha line.", "solution": "Moseley found experimentally that the x-ray line spectrum varies in a regular way from element to element, unlike the irregular variations of optical spectra. This regular variation occurs because characteristic x-rays are due to transitions involving the innermost electrons of the atom. Because of the shielding of the other elec-trons the inner electron energies do not depend on the com-plex interactions of the outer electrons, which are respon-sible for the complicated optical spectra. Also, the inner electrons are shielded from the interatomic forces respon-sible for the binding of the atoms in solids, According to the Bohr model of the atom, the energy of an electron in the first orbit is proportional to the square of the nuc-lear charge. Mosely therefore, reasoned that the energy, and thus the frequency, of a characteristic x-ray photon should vary as the square of the atomic number of the element. He plotted the square root of the frequency of particular x-ray lines versus the atomic number Z of theelement. He found that his curves could be described by the general equation, equation, f = A^2 (Z - b)^2 f = A^2 (Z - b)^2 Where f is the frequency of the x-ray and A and b are constants for each line. One family of lines, called the K-series, has b = 1. If the bombarding electron in an x-ray tube knocks an electron from the n = 1 inner orbit of a target atom out of the atom, photons are emitted corres-ponding to transitions of other electrons to the vacancy in the n = 1 orbit. The lowest frequency line corresponds to the lowest energy transition, from n = 2 to n = 1. This line is called the K_\\alpha line. Bohr's relation for the frequency of a photon emitted from a one electron atom is, f = Z^2 [(2\\pi^2m e^4) / {(4\\piE_0)^2 h^3}] [{1/(n_2^2)} - {1/(n_1^2)}](2) The energy E of a photon is given by hf.

The gravitational acceleration at the surface of the earth is written as g = (GM_E)/(R^2_E) = 9.8 m/sec^2.

Suppose that the resistance is replaced by a coil of resistance 5 \\Omega and reactance 0.1 H, and that the current drawn from the generator is adjusted to the same value as before. What length of trace will be obtained and what is the rate of heat production in the coil?", "solution": "When the 100\\rule{1em}{1pt}V battery is applied to the deflector plates, a deflection of 12 cm (= d_1 in Fig. A) is obtained. The displacement per volt is thus 1.2 mm. (See Fig. A). When the ac voltage across the resistor is applied to the cathode ray tube, a trace of length 17 cm is obtained and the voltmeter reads only 50 V. At first sight this might appear to give a different displace-ment per volt, but this is not so. The reading on the voltmeter is the root\\rule{1em}{1pt}mean\\rule{1em}{1pt}square (rms) value of the alternating voltage. The peak value is given by the rms value multiplied by \\surd2 or 50\\surd2 = 70.7 V. The trace on the screen is responsive to the instantane-ous voltage applied to the plates. It therefore marks a movement of the spot from the position where it is subjected to the peak value to the position where it is subjected to minus the peak voltage. (See Figure B). In other words, the length of the trace corres-ponds to a deflection due to a change of 70.7 \\rule{1em}{1pt} (\\rule{1em}{1pt} 70.7) = 141.4 V. The displacement per volt is 17 cm/141.4 = 1.2 mm, in agreement with the dc measurement. The rms current through the resistor is I = (V/R) = (50 V/20 \\Omega) = 2.5 A. This is the current an ammeter would read. When the resistor is replaced by a coil, we are given that the (rms) current remains the same (see Fig. C). The rms voltage across the coil is V = IZ, where Z is the magnitude of the impedance of the series combination of the resistance and the inductance.

{"question": "Two circular cylinders have the same mass and dimensions, but one is solid while the other is a thin hollow shell. If they are released together to roll without slipping down a plane inclined at 30\\textdegree to the horizontal, how far apart will they be after 10 s?", "solution": "In either case the forces acting on the cylinder are as shown in the diagram. The weight mg^\\ding{217} acting downward is split up into its components parallel to and perpendicular to the plane. The other two forces acting on the cylinder are the normal force N^\\ding{217} exerted by the plane and the frictional force attempting to prevent motion, F^\\ding{217}, which has magnitude \\muN. Since the cylinder does not lift from the plane, N = mg cos 30\\textdegree. Further, by Newton's second law, mg sin 30\\textdegree - \\muN = mg(sin 30 - \\mu cos 30) = ma, where m is the mass of the cylinder and a the acceleration produced. Rotation about the center of the cylinder also takes place. Since we are dealing with rotations of dis-tributed masses, a relation involving the moment of iner-tia must be used. That relation is the rigid body analogue of Newton's second law, F = ma, or \\cyrchar\\CYRG = I\\alpha where the torque \\cyrchar\\CYRG corresponds to F, the moment of inertia I corresponds to m, and the angular acceleration \\alpha of the cylinder corresponds to a. If an axis is taken about the center of the sphere, then the only torque acting on the sphere is \\muNr due to the frictional force \\muN. Then \\muNr = \\mur mg cos 30\\textdegree = l\\alpha, Since no slipping takes place, the point A is instantan-eously at rest.

{"question": "Design an experiment which would select for a nutritional mutant .", "solution": "Organisms possess structures called genes which determine their characteristics . A gene is capable of changing, or mutating, to a different form so that it determines an altered characteristic. Any organism that has a specific mutation is called a mutant. Among the large variety of bacterial mutants are those which exhibit an increased tolerance to inhibitory agents such as antibiotics. There are also mutants that exhibit an altered ability to produce some end product, and mutants that are nutritionally deficient (unable to synthesize or utilize a particular nutrient.) These nutritional mutants are calledauxotrophsbecause they require some nutrient not required by the original cell type or prototroph. The first step in isolating a nutritional mutant is to increase the spontaneousmutation rate of the bacteria, which usually ranges from 10^\\rule{1em}{1pt}6 to 10^\\rule{1em}{1pt}10 bacterium per generation.(This means that only 1 bacterium in 1 million to 1 in 10 billion is likely to undergo a mutational change.) The mutationrate can be significantly increased by exposing a bacterial culture (e.g. Escherichia coli), to ultraviolet radiation or x-rays. A portion of the irradiatedE.coliculture is placed on the surface of a Petri dish, and spread over the surface to ensure the isolation of colonies. This Petri dish must contain a \"complete\" medium, such as nutrient agar, so that all bacteria will grow, including the nutritional mutants . Nutrient media contain all the essential nutrients needed for growth . After incubation of this \"complete\" medium plate, the exact position of the colonies on the plate is noted. A replica plating device is then gently pressed to the surface of the complete plate, raised, and then pressed to the surface of a \"minimal\" media plate. A replica plating device consists of a sterile velveteen (a cotton fabric woven like velvet) cloth. Cells from each colony adhere to the cloth in specific locations so that each colony remains isolated. These cells serve as aninoculumwhen the cloth is pressed to another plate. The replica plating devicetranfersthe exact pattern of colonies from plate to plate. The positioning of the cloth on the \"minimal\" agar plate must be identical to its positioning when originally pressed to the complete plate. Colony locations will then be comparable on each of the two plates, which are termed \"replicas.\" The \"minimal\" medium consists only of glucose and inorganic salts, which are nutrients which normally permit the growth ofE.coli. From these basic nutrients , normalE. colican synthesize all required amino acids, vitamins, and other essential components. After incubation, colonies appear on the minimal plate at most of the positions corresponding to those on the complete plate. Those missing colonies on the minimal plate are assumed to be nutritional mutants, becausethey cannot grow on a glucose inorganic salts medium. These missingcolonies can be located on the complete media plate by comparing the location of colonies on the replicas. If they had not been irradiated , and if mutations did not occur, all the colonies would have been able to grow on this minimal medium. The colonies that did grow were not affected by the irradiation, and were non-mutants. To determine the exact nutritional deficiency of theauxotrophs, one can plate them on media which contain specific vitamins or amino acids in addition to glucose and inorganic salts. These compounds are normally synthesized byprototrophicE. coli. The mutation might have affected a gene which controls the formation of an enzyme which, in turn, regulates a stepin the biosynthesis of one of these nutrients. By plating the mutant on several plates with each plate containing an additional specific nutrient, wecould determine which nutrient the mutant cannot synthesize. The mutant will grow on that plate containing the specific nutrient which the mutant is unable to synthesize.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F05-0127.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Increase the spontaneous mutation rate of the bacteria by exposing a bacterial culture to ultraviolet radiation or x-rays, then use a replica plating device to transfer the exact pattern of colonies from a complete medium plate to a minimal media plate.

The period of the motion is 2s and the ampli-tude .2 rad. One of the chairs becomes unbolted and just starts to slip when the angular displacement is a maximum. Calculate the coefficient of static friction between chair and platform. (The rim is 12 ft. from the center).", "solution": "In order to find the coefficient of static friction, we must use Newton's Second Law to relate the acceleration of the seat to the net force acting on it. Now, the platform and seat are oscillating about an axis through C (see figure (A)) with a maximum angular displacement \\texttheta_0. Since the motion is simple harmonic, we may write \\texttheta = \\texttheta_0 cos (\\omega_0t + \\rho)(1) which gives us the angular displacement of a point on the disc (and, hence, the seat) as a function of time. Note that \\rho is an arbitrary constant, which is determined by the way the angular motion begins, and \\omega_0 is the angular frequency of the motion. Differentiating (1) twice \\omega = d\\texttheta/dt = - \\texttheta_0 \\omega_0 sin (\\omega_0t + \\rho)(2) \\alpha = d\\omega/dt = - \\texttheta_0 \\omega0^2 cos (\\omega_0t + \\rho)(3) Here, \\omega and \\alpha are the angular velocity and acceleration of a point on the disc. Since the seat has an angular acceleration \\alpha, it also has a tangential acceleration a_t such that a_t = \\alphaR = - \\texttheta_0 \\omega0^2R cos (\\omega_0t + \\rho)(4) where R is the platform radius (and the distance of the seat from C, see figure (A)). In addition, the seat also has a radial acceleration, a_r pointing inward towards C. The value of a_r is a_r = \\omega^2 R = \\texttheta0^2 \\omega0^2R sin^2 (\\omega_0t + \\rho)(5) The net acceleration a is then a^2 = at^2 + ar^2 a^2 = \\texttheta_0 ^2 \\omega04R^2 cos^2 (\\omega_0t + \\rho) + \\texttheta0^4 \\omega0^2 R^2 sin^4 (\\omega_0t + \\rho) a^2 = \\texttheta_0^2 \\omega04R^2 [cos^2 (\\omega_0t + \\rho) + \\texttheta_0^2 sin^4 (\\omega_0t + \\rho)] ora = \\texttheta_0- \\omega_02R [cos^2 (\\omega_0t + \\rho) + \\texttheta_0^2 sin^4 (\\omega_0t + \\rho)]^1/2(6) If we assume the chair is unbolted, there are 2 sets of forces acting on the chair. In the vertical direction (perpendicular to the disc) 2 forces act - the normal force N of the disc on the chair, and its weight, mg (m is the chair's mass). Since the chair stays on the platform, there is no acceleration in the vertical direction, and N and mg balance: N = mg(7) In the plane of the disc, the only force acting is the force of static friction, f_s. By Newton's Second Law, this must equal the product of the chair's mass and acceleration.

Now that k is determined, we can obtain the value of V corresponding to the given values of P by using the formula V = k/P. (a)P = 4.00 atm:V = (k/P) = [(1.00 l-atm.)/(4.00 atm)] = 0.25 l (b)P = 760 torr = 760 torr \u00d7 [(1 atm)/(760 torr)] = 1 atm: V = (k/P) = [(1.00 l-atm.)/(1atm)] = 1.00 l (c)P = 1.8 \u00d7 10^-3 torr = 1.8 \u00d7 10^-3 torr \u00d7 [(1 atm)/(760 torr)] = 2.3 \u00d7 10^-6 atm: V = (k/P) = [(1.00 l-atm.)/(2.3 \u00d7 10^-6 atm)] = 4.35 \u00d7 10^5 l.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E02-0030.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "(a) 0.25 l, (b) 1.00 l, (c) 4.35 \u00d7 10^5 l"}
{"question": "Define stack, queue, anddeque. What characteristics of these three list structures make each of them useful for different applications?", "solution": "A queue is a type of list structure with the lim-itation that items may be added or deleted at either end, but not in the middle. The term queue is also used in con-nection with computer memory to mean a group of items chained together sequentially by addresses. But here, we will dis-cuss the queue as a way of entering data at the macro level. Queue is a general term which describes several types of lists. One type of queue is known as a FIFO queue, which stands for \"first-in-first out.\" Items that are added to a FIFO queue at one end are removed at the other. The other type of queue is a LIFO queue, which stands for \"last-in- first-out.\" This type of queue is known as a stack. Stacks have the property that the items are removed in the reverse of the order in which they are entered. In addition, a stack allows insertions and deletions to take place only at one end. The termdequeis an acronym for \"double-ended queue\", in which items may be added to, or deleted from, either end. This type of list may be constructed with a double set of pointers, one to keep track of items moving up the list, and one to keep track of items moving down the list. One sample application of queues is in the simulation of customer arrival at a ticket window. New customers coming up to the window can be placed at one end of a queue which represents the line of prospective ticket buyers. When the tickets are bought, the customer is removed from the list at the opposite end. Using this concept, the owner of the ticket booth can simulate the flow of customers and plan his business activities accordingly. Stacks are especially useful in processing data struc-tures such as trees. Stacks can also be used when converting expressions in algebraic notation to Polish expressions. Recursive procedures, sometimes found in PL/1 programs, use the notion of stacks to allocate additional memory space for themselves. Deques, since they can be constructed with two sets of pointers, are ideal for two-way, or undirected, lists. This allows the user to search a list back and forth from either end.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G07-0137.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "A queue is a list structure with items added or deleted at either end.

{"question": "High-level languages specifically provide us with subroutines tolessen repetitious coding. How does a simple subroutine ofFORTRAN compare to a basic assembler language subroutine? What specifically does assembler languageuse forrepetitious procedures?", "solution": "Although both are referred to as subroutines, the subroutine of the high-levellanguage and that of assembler show no noteworthy similarities. We will not be concerned with the functions of the two subroutines that are usedas examples, for this is not relevant to our discussion. Our attention willbe primarily focused on the manner in which these subroutines are called , the passing of parameters, and ending procedure. Let us consider the subroutine of FORTRAN This subroutine is initiated by a 'CALL' statement in the main program. This CALL statement has parameters that are passed to the subroutine. In general, it is only through the CALL statement that a subroutine can be accessed. In addition the subroutines may be said to be completely depen-dent on the operands passed to it by the main program. Now on inspecting the subroutine of the IBM/360-370 computers, we find something completely different. The sub-routine is not called but is branched to as if the computer was branching to any other part of the main program. There are no operands passed in this branching process and hence, the subroutine is not dependent on the main program. In fact, the subroutine of the 360-370 computer could quite easily be mistaken for just another part of the main program. The subroutine of the high-level language requires an 'END' statement whereas that of assembler does not. When the end of the high- level subroutine is found, control auto-matically returns to the instruction that comes immediately after the call of the subroutine. With the assembler subroutine, the computer has to be directed (branch) to this instruction . The high-level subroutine is generally placed outside of the main program but, the subroutine of the as-sembler language is almost like another part of the main program. The following example will clearly illustrate the difference between the two subroutines: Example 1A FORTRAN: CALLLARGER (DATA1,DATA2,MAXI) \\textbullet \\textbullet \\textbullet C THIS SUBROUTINE FINDS THE LARGER OF TWO NUMBERS SUBROUTINE LARGER (FIRST, SECOND, RESULT) INTEGER FIRST, SECOND, RESULT IF (FIRST. GT. SECOND) RESULT = FIRST IF (SECOND. GT. FIRST) RESULT = SECOND RETURN END Example 1B (Basic Assembler Language Subroutine) Assembly: BAL11, LCNTRT 1 \\textbullet \\textbullet \\textbullet \\textasteriskcenteredLINECOUNTING AND PRINTING SUBROUTINE LCNTRTLCPLINECNT, = P '50' BLLCNTRT2 OUTPRTOUT, HDGLINE ZAPLINECNT, = P '0' MV1WORKAREA, C '0' LCNTRT2PUTPRTOUT, WORKAREA APLINECNT, = P '1' BR11 For FORTRAN: The CALL statement initiates the subroutine, and passes operands DATA1, DATA2 and MAXI to it. This data is accepted by FIRST, SECOND and RESULT respectively. Note, the data is 'accepted' in the order in which it is passed, so DATA1 is accepted by FIRST, DATA2 by SECOND and MAXI by RESULT. In-cidentally, 'LARGER' is the name of this routine , and its end is indicated by the END statement. At this point the computer goes back to the instruction following CALL LARGER (DATA1, DATA2, MAXI) statement. For Assembler: The BAL statement tells the computer to branch to the label LCNTRT1, but before doing this, it must store the ad-dress of the next instruction in register 11. Going to LCNTRT1, the assembler processes the instructions until it comes to the BR 11 instruction. Here, the computer branches to the address previously stored in register 11. This is the address of the instruction following the BAL 11, LCNTRT1 instruction. So, as you can see, these two subroutines have almost nothing in common . The subroutine of a high-level language is comparable to that of an assembler MACRO. The calling procedure and operand passing are quite similar, as the following example illustrates. Example 2 SUMWDS5,WORDA, WORDB \\textbullet \\textbullet \\textbullet MACRO SUMWDS,ER1, EW1, EW2 SRER1, ER2 AER1, EW1 AER1, EW2 MEND In the main program the name of the macro (SUMWDS) calls the macro. The operands following the name are passed to the macro and accepted exactly like those illustrated in example 1A. The word MACRO indicates the start of the macro. The end is indicated by MEND. At this point control goes back, in the main program, to the instruction immedi-ately following the call (SUMWDS 5, WORDA,WORDB).", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G09-0198.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The subroutine of the high-level language and that of assembler show no noteworthy similarities.

{"question": "Suppose the collision in the figure is completely inelastic and that the masses and velocities have the values shown. What is the velocity of the 2 mass system after the collision? What is the kinetic energy before and after the collision?", "solution": "Since we wish to relate the final velocity of the system to its initial velocity, we will use conservation of momentum The total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision, if no forces external to the system act. Hence m_Av^\\ding{217}_Ai + m_Bv^\\ding{217}_Bi = (m_A + m_B)v^\\ding{217} where v^\\ding{217}_Ai, v^\\ding{217}_Bi are the initial velocities of m_A and m_B, and v^\\ding{217} is the final velocity of the combined masses. Solv-ing for v, v^\\ding{217} = (m_Av^\\ding{217}_Ai + m_Bv^\\ding{217}_Bi) / (m_A + m_B) Changing the vectors to magnitudes, and noting that v^\\ding{217}_Ai and v^\\ding{217}_Bi are in the opposite directions v = (m_A v_Ai - m_Bv_Bi) / (mA+ m_B) where v_Ai is in the positive x direction. Therefore, v = [(5 kg)(2 m/s) - (3 kg)( 2 m/s)] / [8 kg] v = .5 m/s Since v_2 is positive, the system moves to the right after the collision. The kinetic energy of body A before the collision is (1/2) m_Av^2 _Ai = (1/2)(5 kg)(4 m^2/s^2) = 10 joules and that of body B is (1/2) m_Bv^2_Bi = (1/2)(3 kg)(4 m^2/s^2) = 6 joules The total kinetic energy before collision is there-fore 16 joules. Note that the kinetic energy of body B is positive, although its velocity vBi and its momentum mv_Bi are both negative. The kinetic energy after the collision is (1/2) (m_A + m_B)v^2 = (1/2) (8 kg) (.25 m^2/s^2) = 1 joule Hence, far from remaining constant, the final kinetic energy is only 1/16 of the original, and 15/16 is \"lost\" in the collision. If the bodies couple together like two freight cars, most of this energy is converted to heat through the production of elastic waves which are eventually absorbed. If there is a spring between the bodies and the bodies are locked together when their velocities be-come equal, the energy is trapped as potential energy in the compressed spring. If all these forms of energy are taken into account, the total energy of the system is conserved although its kinetic energy is not. However, momentum is always conserved in a collision, whether or not the collision is elastic.", "images": ["images/D06-0321_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Physics/D06-0321.htm", "image_question": true, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The velocity of the 2 mass system after the collision is .5 m/s to the right.

{"question": "A cattle breeder wants to establish a pure-breeding herd of roan short-horned cattle. What could you tell him about his chances for success in such a venture?", "solution": "Using information obtained in the previous problem we can determine if it is possible to establish a pure-breeding line of roan cattle. Roan short-horned cattle are heterozygotes. Since they have both codominant genes (the gene for red color and the gene for white color) it is impossible for them to ever breed pure. To illustrate this, let us look at the results of a mating between a roan cow and bull. Let R represent the gene for red color and W represent the gene for white color. Red cattle have the genotype RR. White cattle have the genotype WW. Roan cattle, because their color results from equal contribution of both red and white, have the genotype RW. If we mate two roan cattle: We see that one red and one white individual will be produced for every two roan individuals. Therefore, a cattle breeder might get twice as many roan cattle than red or white, but he can never be assured of having a pure-breeding herd of roan cattle. If the breeder would settle for having large numbers of roan cattle within his herd, he could continue to mate roan cattle together, but now, whenever red or white cattle are produced, mate them to each other.

In either case, if the processor determines that it has encountered an integer, the sign of this integer is indicated by using the leftmost bit of the 2 or 4 byte field. If the integer is positive this bit is zero, if it is negative the bit is one. The computers store packed decimal numbers by placing two decimal digits in each byte (8 bits) field. This is done for all the bytes of the field with the exception of the rightmost. For this byte, the rightmost four bits in-dicate the sign of the number. If the number is positive, the sign is an 'F' or a 'C', if negative, it is a 'D'. The length of a packed decimal field can be between 1 and 16 bytes.

{"question": "What is the structure of a sponge? How do sponges obtain food and water?", "solution": "The most primitive metazoans belong to the phylum Porifera and are commonly called the sponges. Sponges may be radially symmetrical, but more commonly they are asymmetrical animals, consisting of loose aggregations of cells which are poorly arranged into tissues. The surface of a sponge is perforated by small openings, or in current pores, which open into the interior cavity, the atrium or spongocoel. The atrium opens to the outside by a large opening at the top of the tube--shaped sponge, called the osculum. There is a constant stream of water passing through the incurrent pores into the atrium, and out through the osculum. The body wall is relatively simple. The outer surface is covered by flattened polygonal cells called pinacocytes. The pores are guarded by cells called porocytes, which are modified pinacocytes, and are shaped like tubes extending from the outside of the sponge to the spongocoel. The pore, or ostium, can be regulated by contractions in the outer end of the porocyte. The mesohyl, a layer consisting of a gelatinous protein matrix, contains skeletal material and amoeboid cells, and lies directly beneath the pinacoderm. The skeletal material may be calcareous or siliceous spicules, or protein spongin fibers, or a combination of the last two. The composition, size and shape of these spicules form the basis for the classification of species of sponges. Though the spicules are located in the mesohyl, they frequently project through the pinacoderm. The skeleton, whether composed of spicules or spongin fibers, is secreted by amoebocytes called sclerocytes. Amoedboid cells in the mesohyl include the archaeocytes. These calls are capable of forming other types of cells that are needed by the sponge. The inner side of the mesohyl, lining the atrium, is a layer of cells called choanocytes, or collar cells. The characteristic shape of a choanocyte is ovoid, with a flagellum surrounded by a collar. The choanocytes are responsible for the movement of water through the sppnge and for obtaining food. The current is produced by the beating of the flagella of the choanocytes. The flagella are oriented toward the spongocoel, and beat in a spiral manner from their base to their tip. As a result of this, water is sucked into the spongocoel through the incurrent pores. Sponges feed on very fine particulate matter. Only particles smaller than a certain size can pass through the pores. Food particles are brought inside the spongocoel by water currents. Larger food particles are phagocytized by amoebocytes lining the inhalant chamber. Particles of bacterial size or below are probably removed and engulfed by the choanocytes. It is thought that the amoebocytes act as storage centers for food reserves. Egested wastes leave the body in water currents. There are three basic structural types of sponges. The simplest, called the asconoid type, has been described earlier when basic sponge structure was discussed. The syconoid and leuconoid types are more complex, having thicker mesohyls and a greater number of water channels, but their structures can be seen to be just complexes of asconoid sponges attached to one another.", "images": ["images/F11-0275_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F11-0275.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Sponges are asymmetrical animals, consisting of loose aggregations of cells which are poorly arranged into tissues.

{"question": "Phylum Hemichordate is believed to be the most closely related to our own phylum, Chordate. What is the evidence for this? How are the echinoderms linked to chordates?", "solution": "The hemichordates are marine animals, often called acorn worms. They live in U-shaped burrows in sand or mud. The body is bilaterally symmetrical and consists of a conical proboscis, a short collar, and a long trunk. The hemichordates' embryonic development is similar to that of the chordates. The echinoderms, hemichordates, and chordates are deuterostomes. The characteristics shared by these phyla are the formation of the anus from the embryonic blastopore. They also undergo radial and in-determinate cleavage, with the origin of mesoderm being from pouches of endoderm, and the formation of the coelom as the cavities in the mesodermal pouches. The other in-vertebrate phyla (mollusks, annelids and arthropods) are protosomes. In protosomes, the mouth forms from the blasto-pore, cleavage is determinate and spiral, mesoderm arises from ingrowth of a single cell near the blastopore, and the coelom developes from a split in an initially solid mass of mesoderm. The Deuterostomia and the Protosomia represent two important diverging lines of development from a primi-tive bilaterally symmetrical ancestor. Adult hemichordates resemble chordates in two other ways. The hemichordates have pharyngeal gill slits. Water drawn into the mouth is forced out over these slits in the wall of the pharynx. Oxygen is removed from the water and carbon dioxide is released into it from the blood. Capillary beds are located in the septa between the gill slits. Only chordates and hemichordates have pharyngeal clefts. Hemichordates also have a thick, hollow, dorsal nerve cord in the collar. The anterior region contains a ventral nerve cord as well as a dorsal nerve cord. All chordates have a dorsal hollow nerve cord. The echinoderms are related to the hemichordates. Hemichordates have a hydrostatic skeleton similar to the water vascular system of echinoderms. In addition, there are similarities between their larval stages. The dipleurula larvae of echinoderms and hemichordates are quite alike, and differ from the trochophore larvae of molluscs and annelids. Chordates have no ciliated larval stages similar to both of these. However, this ciliated larvae link between echino-derms and hemichordates is additional indirect evidence of the link between echinoderms and chordates.", "images": ["images/F12-0323_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F12-0323.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The hemichordates' embryonic development is similar to that of the chordates.

{"question": "What are the chief characteristics of the subphylum Vertebrata?", "solution": "In addition to the three basic chordate characteristics, the vertebrates have an endoskeleton of cartilage or bone that reinforces or replaces the notochord. The notochord is the only skeletal structure present in lower chordates, but in the vertebrates there are bony or cartilaginous segmental vertebrae that surround the notochord. In the higher vertebrates the notochord is visible only during embryonic development. Later the vertebrae replace the notochord completely. A part of each vertebra consists of an arch, and all of the vertebrae together form a tunnel-like protection for the dorsal nerve cord. A brain case, skull, or cranium, composed either of cartilage or bone, develops as a protective structure around the brain of all vertebrates. The eyes in vertebrates are unique and differ both in structure and development from those of the inver-tebrates. The eyes of vertebrates develop as lateral outgrowths of the brain. Invertebrate eyes, such as those of insects, may be highly developed and quite efficient, but they develop from a folding of the skin. The formation of ears for detecting sounds is another vertebrate characteristic. The ears also function as organs of equilibrium, as is the major function of the ears in the lowest vertebrates. The circulatory system of vertebrates is distinctive in that the blood is confined to blood vessels and is pumped by a ventral, muscular heart. The higher inver-tebrates such as arthropods andmolluscstypically have hearts but they are located on the dorsal side of the body and pump blood into open spaces in the body, calledhemocoels.

The mass of an alpha particle is 66 \u00d7 10^-24 g. The energy of an alpha particle is given by E = (1/2) mv^2 = 4.8 MeV . Since 1MeVis equal to 1.6 \u00d7 10^-6 erg, we have: (1/2) mv^2 = 4.8 \u00d7 1.6 \u00d7 10^-6 erg. We will employ this value of the energy in order to obtain the value ofmvwithout having to find the velocity of the particle.

{"question": "Trace the evolution of man using the existing classifications and characteristics of fossil men.", "solution": "The fossils of the Dryopithecine date back to about 30 million years ago during the oligocene era. It is believed that there once existed several species of Dryopithecus: Dryopithecus africanus which was thought to be ancestral to the chimpanzee, Dryopithecus major - thought to be ancestral to the gorilla, and Dryopithecus sivolensis thought to be ancestral to the present day orangutan. Although not enough information has been collected to tell exactly when and where the human lineage first started, it is believed that it may have had its roots in the Dryopithe-cine line. The apelike Dryopithecus was probably the ancestor of man. By the middle of Miocene (about 20 million years ago), the evolutionary lines leading to the various types of modern anthropoids were distinct. The first set of fossils found to be considered in the hominid line, representing Ramapithecus, dates back to the upper Miocene epoch (about 10 to 14 million years ago). It must be pointed out, however that this is supported only by vague evidence since only the jaws and teeth from Ramapithecus have been found. The canine and incisor teeth are relatively small in man, and this may be an important distinction from the apes. If Ramapithecus did not use his teeth for defense and his diet changed to one that required more chewing, then this change may have been correlated with the increased use of hands. Since no fossil skull of Ramapithecus has been found, little can be learned about his intelligence. If he did reply more on his hands, there is the implication that he might stand at least semi-erect and use bipedalism at times. A gap of about five million years in man's evolutio-nary history is found between Ramapithecus and the next distinct homonid form, called Australapithecus, who appeared about 5.5 to 1.2 million years ago. Relatively large portions and numbers of the Australopithecine skeleton have been found scattered throughout South and East Africa. An important advance toward the modern human condition shown by the Australopithecines is the acquisition of some degree of bipedalism. They might have stood and walked completely erect or perhaps they were fully erect only while running. From fossil evidence it is deduced that Australopithecus was relatively small, an adult weighing about 75 pounds. His dental anatomy was humanlike, especially that of the canines. His cranial capacity was very small and comparable to that of a present day gorilla. It must however be noted here that although the Australopithecine cranial capacity is comparable to a gorilla's, the ratio of his brain size to body weight is much higher that the gorilla's proportion. Australopithecus probably was not very intelligent but was obviously developing human characteristics and some form of culture. He probably lived in a group and had a daily hunting-gathering mode of living. This is supported by the finding of bones of small animals and evidence of gathered fruits, nuts, and shoots at or around excavated sites. Stone tools are found also at these sites and are of a style either known as pebble tools or as the Oldowan industry. Therefore, Australopithecus was a toolmaker as well as a tool user, a feature much less common among animals other than man himself. A later stage in human evolution is represented by a group of fossil men, including Java and Peking man, that can be classified as Homo erectus. This species first appeared about 1.2 million years ago and existed till about years ago. As compared to Australopithecus, Homo erectus had greater body size, increased cranial capacity, reduced facial shape and dental structure, and the beginning of a human type culture. A major feature found in Homo erectus is the elaboration of cultural adaptations that originated in the earlier Australopithecine stage. The cultural associations of Homo erectus, in the making of tools (called Acheulian tools) and in social activities, are more complex than those associated with the Australopithecines. By the Homo erectus stage of human evolution, adap-tations based on culture are seemingly well established. If culture is the basis of human adaptation, then natural selection would favor a more efficient culture. In these fossil men, an enlarged brain is related to an increased capacity for more complex cultural skills and behavior patterns. Reduction in facial and dental structure also may be linked to more efficient use of tools and cooking of food. Homo erectus appear to have led the same kind of life, including the hunting and gathering that characterizes some groups of modern man. Because of their similarities to modern men, these fossil men are included within the genus Homo. The ancestral line, or lines, leading to modern man becomes hazy approximately 300,000 years ago. From around to 150,000 years ago, the fossil record is rather scanty. However, a collection of fossils found in Terra Amata, France, which is about 200,000 to 35,000 years old, gives us a decent picture of man's transition from Homo erectus to Homo sapiens. The structures of these skeletal remains clearly show an increase in brain size, as well as the increasing likeness of facial features to those of modern man. The Homo sapiens neanderthalensis, known as the cavemen, is a hominid group with skulls that were large and massive with a thick, bony ridge over the eyes and a receeding forehead. Their nose was broad and short and there was almost no chin at all. Their cranial capacity was as large as, or larger than that of modern man. In general, these characteristics are intermediate between those of Homo erectus and those of Homo sapiens. The population of Neanderthal men that inhabited regions that are now Europe, North Africa and the Middle East some 75,000 to 35,000 years ago seemed to be both culturally and physically modern. They were a widely spreading species - their remains have been found over a wide area including parts of western Europe, Asia and Africa, indicating that they were able to adapt to various climates. They were a society of small family groups who lived primarily in caves, used fire, made flint weapons of the Mousterian tool tradition, hunted a variety of game ranging in size up to the mammoth and rhinoceros, and buried their dead re-verently with food, flowers and ornaments. This last mentio-ned fact indicates that they were capable of abstract thinking including the concept of a life after death. Reconstruction of one Neanderthal skeleton caused these men to be depicted as standing stooped, with their knees bent forward. However, it has been determined later that this portrayal of Neanderthal man is incorrect. The skeleton used to form this illustration actually come from a man who died at a very old age with rickets, which accounts for the skeleton's deformation. It is now known through examination of many other skeletons that Neanderthal man stood as erect as modern man and was probably just as efficient a bipedal walker. Presently, Neanderthal man is considered to belong to a sub-species of Homo sapiens.", "images": ["images/F29-0759_files/image002.jpg", "images/F29-0759_files/image004.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F29-0759.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The evolution of man traces from Dryopithecus, to Ramapithecus, Australopithecus, Homo erectus, and finally to Homo sapiens."}

{"question": "Discuss the structural and hormonal aspects of insect metamorphosis.", "solution": "Basically, there are two kinds of metamorphosis: incomplete metamorphosis which results in a similiar but larger form, and complete metamorphosis, which gives rise to strikingly different forms. Many insects, such as moths, butterflies and flies undergo metamorphosis. Generally, a wormlike larva \\rule{1em}{1pt} called a caterpillar in moths, maggot in flies, and grub in bees - hatches from the egg. The larva is a relatively active form; it crawls about, eats voraciously, and molts several times, each time becoming larger in size. The last larval molt gives rise to a pupa, an inactive form which typically does not move or eat. Moth and butterfly larvae spin a cocoon around their bodies and molt within the cocoon to form the pupae. During this process all the structures of the larva are broken down and used as raw materials for the development of the adult. Each part of the adult body develops from a group of cells called a disc. The discs are embryonic cells derived directly from the egg and remain quiescent during larval stages. During the pupal stage they grow and differentiate into adult structures such as wings, legs, and eyes. These structures remain collapsed, folded and thus nonfunctional at first; when the pupa molts into the adult form, blood is pumped in to inflate them, and chitin is deposited to make them hard. Metamorphosis in insects is characterized not only by sharp changes in appearance from the larval to the adult form, but also by striking changes in their modes of life. The butterfly larva eats leaves whereas the adult feeds on nectar from flowers. The mosquito larva lives in ponds and eats algae and protozoa, while the adult sucks the blood of humans and other mammals. The process of insect metamorphosis involves a brain hormone, a molting hormone called ecdysone, and a regulatory hormone called the juvenile hormone. The brain hormone stimulates glands in the insect's prothorax (the part of the body immediately behind the head, to which the first pair of legs is attached). The prothoracic glands respond by secreting ecdysone which induces molting. Ecdysone is believed to be involved also in many growth and developmental processes in insects. Juvenile hormone is produced by a pair of glands, called corpora allata, which is located just behind the brain and closely associated with it. High concentrations of juvenile hormone at the time of molting result in another immature stage following the molt, while low concentrations lead to a more advanced stage after molting. This is supported by the demonstration that removal of the corpora allata from insects in a highly immature stage resulted in pupation at the next molt, followed by a molt that resulted in a midget adult. Conversely, implantation of an active corpora allata into an advanced pupa resulted in another immature stage after molting rather than an adult. In the larva, juvenile hormone is present in a high concentration, hence the larva molts to form a pupa. In the pupa, juvenile hormone is absent and thus when the pupa molts an adult results. Notice that insect metamorphosis involves the nervous system as well as endocrine glands. Of the three hormones discussed, one is released directly by the brain (the brain hormone), one is secreted under the influence of the brain hormone (ecdysone),and the third is secreted by glands closely associated with the brain (juvenile hormone). The interactions between these three hormones are shown in the accompanying figure.", "images": ["images/F12-0316_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F12-0316.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": true, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Insect metamorphosis involves a brain hormone, a molting hormone called ecdysone, and a regulatory hormone called the juvenile hormone."}
{"question": "A woman who is Rh-negative marries a man who is Rh- positive. What possible problems could arise if the couple wants more than one child?", "solution": "Besides the A and B agglutinogens, there is another type of blood antigen, designated the Rh factor. There are at least eight different types of Rh antigens which may be present on human erythrocytes. People are classified into two groups with respect to the Rh antigen: Rh-positive individuals have an Rh antigen, while Rh- negative individuals have such a weakly antigenic factor that it can be disregarded. The A\\rule{1em}{1pt}B\\rule{1em}{1pt}O blood type system is an example of a rare case in which the body normally synthesizes antibodies in large amounts against an antigen to which it has not yet been exposed. The Rh system follows the rule rather than the exception. An individual's plasma will not con-tain an antibodies against the Rh antigen unless it has been sensitized to the antigen by previous exposure. Thus, while Rh-positive individuals have the Rh antigen, Rh-negative individuals have neither an effective antigen nor an antibody against the antigen. If Rh-positive blood is given to an Rh negative individual, the Rh-negative individual will gradually synthesize antibodies against the Rh antigen introduced. Agglutination of the cells occurs, plugging up the small blood vessels, inactivating the erythrocytes as oxygen carriers, and eventually leading to death of the recipient. In our particular problem, the couple's first child might inherit the Rh-negative characteristic. There is thus no particular problem since the mother is also Rh-negative. But if the fetus is Rh-positive, trouble may occur. If some blood from the Rh-positive fetus enters the maternal circulation, its antigens stimulate the mother's plasma cells to synthesize Rh antibodies. Normally, the mother cannot produce antibodies rapidly enough and in large enough amounts to affect the first child before birth. But if the mother, who is Rh-sensitized by the first pregnancy, has subsequent pregnancies, she will have produced sufficient antibodies which can diffuse into the blood of an Rh-positive fetus and react with its erythrocytes. This agglutination of the blood of the fetus with the antibodies produced in its mother is a disease known as erythroblastosis fetalis. Only about 3% of the second or later Rh-positive fetuses born to Rh-negative mothers show signs of erythroblastosis fetalis. The blood of the mother may not diffuse into the fetal circulation, thus preventing agglutination. In addition, only one of the types of Rh antigens is responsible for erythroblastosis; other forms will not cause any trouble. Also, the longer the time interval between pregnancies, the less intense is the anti-Rh immunal response in the mother. One method of preventing erythroblastosis is to in-ject Rh antibodies into a Rh-negative mother immediately after the birth of her first Rh positive infant. The antibodies kill any fetal red blood cells that have en tered her circulation and thus prevent stimulation of maternal antibody production. The injected antibodies eventually are destroyed arid the mother is now unsensi-tized and able to bear a second Rh-positive infant.", "images": ["images/F14-0371_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F14-0371.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "Erythroblastosis fetalis"}

The dancer is initially rotating at angular velocity \\cyrchar\\cyromega_0, and she has a moment of inertia I_0. After she pulls her arms in, she has decreased her moment of inertia to I_f. We observe that she has an increased angular velocity, \\cyrchar\\cyromega_f, and we may therefore write I0\\cyrchar\\cyromega_0 = I_f \\cyrchar\\cyromegaf Since I\\cyrchar\\cyromega is angular momentum, we have motivated the principle of conservation of angular momentum L_0 = Lf where L_0 and L_f are the initial and final angular moment. This general principle holds whenever no external torques act on the system which we are observing. In the present case, we may apply this principle to find the final angular velocity of the earth. We then relate this to the period of the earth's rotation, and, hence, the length of the day.

{"question": "Two different compounds of elements A and B were found to have the following composition: first compound, 1.188 g of A combined with 0.711 g of B; second compound, 0.396 g of A combined with 0.474 g of B. (a) Show that these data are in accord with the law of multiple proportions, (b) If the formula for the first compound is AB_2, what is the formula for the second?", "solution": "(a) The law of multiple proportions can be stated: When two elements combine to form more than one compound, the different weights of one that combine with a fixed weight of the other are in the ratio of small whole numbers. This means that if one solves for the expected amount of B that is used in forming the second compound from the ratio of A : B in experiment one, the experimental amount should be a multiple of the calculated value. This is seen more clearly after looking at the data. In experiment 1, A combines with B in a ratio of 1.188 g A : 0.711 g B or 1 : .598. In experiment 2, A combined with B in a ratio of 0.396 A : 0.479 B or 1 : 1.20. The law of multiple proportions states that .598 should be a small multiple of 1.20. 1.20/.598 = 2, thus the law is supported. (b) If the formula for the first compound is AB_2, one knows that the proportion of the number of moles of A to B is 1 : 2. Thus 1 unit volume of A weighs 1.188 g and 2 units of B weigh 0.711 g. Therefore, 1 unit of B weighs 0.711 g/2 = 0.356 g. Using this data, one solves for the number of units of A in the second compound by dividing the weight of A in compound 2 by 1.188 g. no. of units of A in compound 2 = (.396g) / (1.188g/unit)= .311 units no. of units of B in compound 2 = (.474) / (.356 g/unit) = 1.331 units The ratio of A to B in compound 2 can now be found. Let x = no. of B atoms A / B = .311 / 1.331 = 1 / x x = 1.331 / .311 = 4.0 Therefore, the second compound is AB_4. This result could also have been obtained by using the data from part (a) .

{"question": "The heart is removed from the body and placed in an isosmotic solution. Although it is completely separated from nerves, it continues to beat. Explain.", "solution": "The initiation of the heartbeat and the beat itself are intrinsic properties of the heart and are not dependent upon stimulation from the central nervous system. The heart is stimulated by two sets of nerves (the sympathetic and vagus nerves), but these only partly regulate the rate of the beat, and are not responsible for the beat itself. The initiation of the heartbeat originates from a small strip of specialized muscle in the wall of the right atrium called the sino-atrial (S-A) node, which is also called the pacemaker of the heart. It is the S-A node which generates the rhythmic self-excitatory impulse, causing a wave of con-traction across the walls of the atria. (See figure). This wave of contraction reaches a second mass of nodal muscle called the atrio-ventricular node, or A-V node. The atrio-ventricular node is found in the lower part of the interatrial septum. As the wave of contraction reaches the A-V node, the wave stimulates the node, which produces an excitatory impulse. This impulse is rapidly transmitted to a bundle of nodal fibers called the A-V bundle or bundle of His. This bundle divides into right and left bundle bunches which ramify to the ventricular myocarium (the muscular layer of the heart wall) via the Purkinje fibers. The impulse is then transmitted to all parts of the ventricles causing them to contract as a unit. As the cardiac impulse travels from the S-A node through the atria, the wave of contraction forces blood through the valves and into the ventricles. (In the atria, the impulse is transmit-ted from cell to cell across the intercalated discs) . It is a \"wave\" of contraction because parts of the atria farthest from the S-A node contract later than do the parts closest to the node. The parts of the atria that contract first are also the first to relax, thus causing a wavelike motion upon contraction. Once the impulse reaches the A-V node, it is delayed (by a fraction of a second) before it is passed on to the ventricles. This transmission delay allows time for the atria to pump the blood into the ventricles before ventricular contraction begins. Unlike the atria, the ventricles contract as a unit. This is due to the rapid trans-mission of the impulse by the Purkinje fibers. For example, in the atria, the impulse travels at a velocity of .3 meter per second while in the Purkinje fibers, the impulse travels at about 2 meters per second. This allows almost immediate transmission of the impulse throughout the ventricular system. The adaptive significance of the contraction of the ventricles as a unit rather than as a wave is clear. The ventricles must exert as great a pressure as possible in order to force the blood throughout a long system of arteries, capillaries and veins. A greater pressure is more easily obtained if the ventricles con-tract as a unit, rather than in waves.", "images": ["images/F15-0376_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F15-0376.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The initiation of the heartbeat and the beat itself are intrinsic properties of the heart and are not dependent upon stimulation from the central nervous system."}
{"question": "The ability to roll the tongue into almost a complete circle is conferred by a dominant gene, while its recessive allele fails to confer this ability.

Explain this by showing the genotypes of all three persons.", "solution": "Let us represent the dominant allele for the trait of tongue-rolling by R, and the recessive allele by r. We know that if a gene is dominant for a trait, it will always be expressed if it is present. Since the son cannot roll his tongue, he cannot possess the dominant gene for this trait, and his genotype must be rr. This means that, each parent must have at least one recessive allele to donate to their son. Also, each parent must have a dominant allele for this trait because they have the ability to roll their tongues. Thus the genotype of parents for this trait must be Rr. We can illustrate this by looking at the mating of two such parents, The offspring will be obtained in the following ratios F1/4 RR,Homozygous dominant;tongue roller. 1/2 Rr,Heterozygous;tongue roller. 1/4rr,Homozygous recessive;non-tongue roller. We see then that there is a one-in-four chance that two parents who are heterozygous for a dominant trait will produce offspring without that trait.

{"question": "There are twelve pairs of cranial nerves in man.

They connect the brain to variouseffectororgans, primarily the sense organs, muscles and glands of the head. Some cranial nerves contain only motor fibers, some contain only sensory fibers, and some contain both types of fibers. In addition, some are composed of parasym-pathetic fibers (which are exclusively motor), the action of which is involuntary. There are twelve pairs of cranial nerves in man. The olfactory nerve (cranial nerve I) is composed en-tirely of afferent fibers carrying impulses for the sense of smell from the olfactory epithelium to the base of the brain. The optic nerve (II) is also entirely sensory and contains afferent fibers running from the retina to the visual center of the brain. The occulomotor (III) andtrochlear(IV) nerves both have afferent and efferent branches which connect the midbrain to the muscles of the eye. Together they are responsible forproprioceptionof the eye muscles, movement of the eyeball,accomodationof the eye, and constriction of the pupil. The trigeminal nerve (V) contains both afferent and efferent fibers running between theponsand the face and jaws. It functions mainly in stimulating movement of the muscles of the jaws involved in chewing. The fibers of theabducensnerve (VI) run between theponsand muscles of the eye. This nerve conveys the sense of position of the eyeball to the brain, and aids the III and IV nerves in effecting mo-vement of the eyeball. The facial nerve (VII) has both afferent and efferent fibers that innervate muscles of the face, mouth, forehead and scalp. It also functions in the transmission of impulses for the sense of taste from the anterior part of the tongue to the brain. The fibers of the auditory nerve orvestibulocochlear(VIII) exclusively afferent, run from the inner ear to the junction of theponsand medulla. These fibers convey the senses of hearing and equilibrium (movement, balance and rotation) to the appropriate centers in the brain. Connecting the medulla to the epithelium and muscles of the pharynx, and to the salivary gland and tongue are the fibers of theglossophar-yngeal nerve (IX) This nerve is responsible for the sense of taste from the posterior part of the tongue and from the lining of the larynx. It is also responsible for the reflex-ive act of swallowing. The tenth cranial nerve, the vagus , has both sensory and motor branches, but the motor fibers are parasympathetic autonomic fibers and thus their action is involuntary. Its sensory fibers originate in many of the internal organs - lungs, stomach, aorta, larynx, to name a few - and its motor (parasympathetic) fibers run to the heart, stomach, small intestine, larynx and esophagus. Be-sides the vagus , the III, VII, and IX nerves also contain parasympathetic fibers, but in smaller amounts. The efferent and afferent branches of the accessory nerve (XI) connect the medulla to the pharynx and larynx and muscles of the shoulder, which they innervate. Afferent fibers of the last cranial nerve, the hypoglossal, convey the sense ofproprio-ceptionfrom the tongue to the medulla, and the efferent fibers stimulate movement of the tongue. The cranial nerves are numberedanteriorlytoposteri-orly. I and II originate in the olfactory epithelium and retina respectively.

Normally, reduced cytochrome a, the final element in the respiratory chain, would be reoxidized by oxygen, but since cyanide inhibits this from occuring, the whole chain is shut off as the intermediate acceptors are all converted to the reduced condition. Consequently, there is a severe decrease in the amount of ATP that can be produced fox life processes, leading to the death of the victim. Hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide have similar effects at this site. Other poisons block either of the first two sites. Looking at the electron transport chain it may not be obvious how the inhibition of the reoxidation of reduced cytochrome a can shut off the entire respiratory chain. Cyanide blocks ATP formation of the third site of ATP synthesis in the chain. However, this does not mean that ATP production still goes on as usual at the first and second site. Some ATP may be produced immedi-ately after cyanide enters the electron transport chain, but eventually production stops. ATP production ceases because of the inability of the intermediate acceptors to oxidize NADH. Inhibition by cyanide generates an accumulation of reduced cytochrome a by preventing its oxidation. Since cytochrome a is in a reduced state, it cannot oxidize its neighbor, reduced cytochrome c. This leads to an accumulation of reduced cytochrome c and then c_1, which, being unable to oxidize cytochrome b, prevents the formation of ATP at the second site. Of more importance is the \"backing up\" of reduced states towards the beginning of the chain leading even-tually to the reduction of all intermediate acceptors. These reduced intermediates cannot accept electrons; ATP formation in the respiratory chain requires inter-mediates to receive electrons which are liberated going from a reduced state to an oxidized state. Therefore, ATP formation cannot proceed normally and, in fact, finally stops if any step in the electron transport chain is blocked.", "images": ["images/F03-0085_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F03-0085.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Cyanide inhibits the final reaction of the respiratory chain, preventing the energy extraction process."}

The general formula for ethers is ROR' where R and R' are alkyl groups and may or may not be the same Both alcohols and ethers derived from alkanes have the same general formula C_nH_2n+2O (ethanol is isomeric with methyl ether). Unlike alcohols, ethers do not form associated molecules by means of hydrogen bonds. Thus, the boiling point of an ether is considerably below the boiling point of its isomeric alcohol. Methyl ether is a gas, bp -23\\textdegreeC, whereas ethanol is a liquid, bp + 78\\textdegreeC. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that methyl ether has a higher vapor pressure than ethanol. Weak hydrogen bonding between water molecules and ether molecules leads to slight water solubility.

{"question": "What are van der Waals forces? What is their significance in biological systems?", "solution": "Van der Waals forces are the weak attractive forces that molecules of non-polar compounds have for one another. These are the forces that allow non-polar compounds to liquefy and/or solidify. These forces are based on the existence of momentary dipoles within molecules of non- polar compounds. A dipole is the separation of opposite charges (positive and negative). A non-polar compound's average distribution of charge is symmetrical, so there is no net dipole. But, electrons are not static, they are constantly moving about. Thus, at any instant in time a small dipole will probably exist. This momentary dipole will affect the distri-bution of charge in nearby non-polar molecules, inducing charges in them. This induction happens because the negative end of the temporary dipole will repel electrons and the positive end attracts electrons. Thus, the neighboring non-polar molecules will have oppositely oriented dipoles: These momentary, induced dipoles are constantly changing, short range forces. But, their net result is attraction between molecules. The attraction due to van der Waals forces steadily increases when two non-bonded atoms are brought closer together reaching its maximum when they are just touching. Every atom has a van der Waals radius. The atoms are said to be touching when the distance between their nuclei is equal to the sum of their van der Waals radii. If the two atoms are then forced closer together, van der Walls attraction is replaced by van der Waals repulsion (the repulsion of the positively charged nuclei). The atoms then try to restore the state in which the distance be-tween their two nuclei equals the sum of their van der Waals radii. Both attractive and repulsive van der Waals forces play important roles in many biological systems.

Assuming there is no delay between the occurrence of surplus or shortage and the price change it causes, write a FORTRAN program which uses the modified Euler method (the method is fully explained, and the subroutine for it is given in the SIMULATION chapter) to simulate this system from time t=o to t=t_F, if the price of the good (in dollars per unit of good) at time t is p(t), p(o) = Po>o, and it is observed that: Case(1): D = f(p(t)) and S = h(p(t)) where f and g are linear quantities. Case (2): D = f(p(t)) is inversely proportional to[p(t)]^2 with proportionality factor d_1>2po and S is directly proportional to [p(t)]^0.11 with proportionality factor s_1. D and S are expressed as units of good per time period. Compare the modified Euler approximations with exact values, where feasible.", "solution": "First note that exogenous factors, such as government price control, will be neglected in this model. Negative demand and supply can be interpreted as return of goods, as the diagram below shows (the arrows represent flow of goods): Also note that D = f(p), S = g(P) implies D, S vary only with price: all other influences (e.g. tastes, income, technological change, etc.) are held fixed in this model. Since both demand and supply depend on price and both determine price, we recognize that this system has feed-back. Therefore, the block diagram of the system will contain a linkage between output and input: The assumed relation between supply, demand and price can be expressed mathematically: \u1e56 = K (D - S)(1) where \u1e57 is the time rate of change of price (in dollars per unit time period) , and K is a constant of propor-tionality, 0<K<1. Equation (1) is dimensionally correct only if K has dimension of dollars per (unit of good)2. This relation can be diagrammed as: The problem is to observe the system when both D = f (p) and S = h(p) are given first by Case 1 and then by Case 2: Case 1: D = f(p) = a_1 + b_1p(t)(2) S = h(p) = a_2 + b_2p(t)(3) where a_2, b_2,a_1 and b_1 are constants, each with dimension: (unit of good)2 per dollar per time period. Substituting equations (2) and (3) into equation (1): \u1e57 = K(a_1 + b_1p - (a_2 + b_2p)) = K = K (a_1 - a_2 -(b_2 - b_1)p)(4) If the time period becomes vanishingly small, the exact solution of equation (4) can be shown to be: p(t) = (A/B) - (A/B - PO) e^-Bt where A = K(a_1 - a_2) and B = K(b_2 - b_1)Note that as t\\rightarrow\\infty, price\\rightarrowA/B. What would happen if the initial price were A/B? Substituting A/B for p in equation (4): \u1e57 = K (a_1 - a2- (b2- b_1) (A/B)) = K [a_1 - a_2 - (b_2 - b_1) ({K(a_1 - a_2)} / {K(b_2 - b_1)}) ] = K [a_1 - a_2 - (b_2 - b_1) {(a_1 - a_2) / (b_2 - b_1)} ] = K [a_1 - a_2 - (a_1 - a_2)] = K [o] = 0 Therefore, if initially, p = A/B, then p = 0 so that price will never change. In fact, whenever price reaches A/B, it will remain there, p = A/B is the equilibrium price. The system is asymptotically stable (at that equilibrium point).

{"question": "What are the major constituents of a productive soil? Whatis the role of each of these constituents in plant growth? What measures can be taken to prevent the loss of topsoil?", "solution": "A rich, fertile soil should contain sufficient quantities of the essential mineralnutrients. It should also contain an adequate amount of organic materials which is provided by humus. In addition, it should include innumerable bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms to bring about decay of organic substances and aeration of the soil. The essential minerals play important roles in the structure and functions of the plant. The broadest role of the minerals is their action in catalyzing enzymatic reactions in the cell. In some cases they act as an essential structural component of the enzyme, in others they act as regulators or activators of certain enzymes. Some minerals, absorbed in the ionic form by active transport, function in providing a hydrostatic pressure , orturgorwithin the cell. In other words, their con-centrations inside the cell or in the surrounding medium regulate the movement of water in and out of the cell. Some minerals regulate the permeability and integrity of cell membranes, while others serve as structural components of cell parts. Other minerals constitute structural parts of the electron acceptors of the electron transport system, such as thecytochromesand ferredoxin . Still others act as buffering agents to prevent drastic changes in pH within the cell. Humus, derived from the decaying remains of plants and animals , provides the soil with organic nutrients, among them mainly carbon - and nitrogen-containing compounds. In addition, humus increases the porosity of soil so that proper drainage and aeration can occur, and enhances the ability of the soil to absorb and hold water. To bring about decomposition of the humus, a good soil should contain a large number of bacteria, fungi, and other small organisms. Such organisms, as the earthworms, benefit the soil further by constantly tilling the soil, aerating it, and mixing in additional organic substances. A major conservation problem all over the world is to decrease the amount of valuable topsoil carried away each year by wind and water. Reforestation of mountain slopes, building check dams in gullies to decrease the spread of the run-off water, contour cultivation, terraces and the planting of windbreaks are some of the successful methods that are currently being used to protect the topsoil against erosion.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F10-0263.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "A productive soil should contain essential mineral nutrients, organic materials provided by humus, and microorganisms for decay and aeration.

In these animals the lower limb bones are lengthened, raising the wrist and ankle farther off the ground. This type of locomotion is known asunguligrade. In the case of the horse, the leg is supported by one digit, terminating in a hoof, whereas in cattle, two digits are used for support, terminating in two hoofs.

{"question": "The pendulum in figure 1 consists of a homogeneous prismatic bar of mass m and length l, which hangs at rest on its frictionless suspension O. A spherical pellet of mass m travels with a horizontal velocity v_1 and strikes it in the middle. Immediately after the impact, the pellet moves with velocity v_2 to the right and the pendulum begins to rotate about O with initial angular velocity \\omega. Solve for v_2 and \\omega in terms of v_1 for the cases in which the collision is: 1.) completely elastic, and 2.) completely inelastic.", "solution": "Since not only the normal force, but also the reaction at O, becomes large during the impact, the principle of impulsive forces is useless for the determination of v_2 and \\omega. However, here we can apply the principle of impul-sive moments about O. The angular momentum about O of the system of two bodies before the impulse originates from the pellet alone. It is normal to the plane of motion and has the magnitude. H_(0)1 = m(l / 2)v_1 .(1) The total angular momentum immediately after the impulse has the same direction and the magnitude H_(0)2 = m(l / 2)v_2 + (ml^2 / 3)\\omega.(2) The second term in equation (2) is the angular momen-tum of the bar, I\\omega, where I is the moment of inertia of the bar about O, which is equal to ml^2 / 3. Since no external forces that have a static moment about O become large during the impulse, we have H(0)1= H(0)2or substituting the values from (1) and (2), m(l / 2)v_2 + (ml^2 / 3)\\omega = m(l / 2)v_1 .(3)- If the impulse is elastic the kinetic energy of the system is conserved. Thus we have (m/2)^v2 _2 + (1/2) (ml^2 / 3)\\omega^2 = (m/2)v^2 _1.(4) Hence, by (3) and (4) we have the following equations for the determination of v_2 and \\omega: v_2 + (2 / 3)l\\omega= v_1,v2_2 + (1 / 3)l^2\\omega^2 = v2_1 . In addition, we have the requirement that (l / 2)\\omega \\geq v_2. The solution yields \\omega = (12 / 7)(v_1 / l) and v_2 = \\rule{1em}{1pt}(1 / 7) v_1. Thus, both bodies move after the impulse, and in such a way that the speed of the pellet relative to the pendulum if v^1_2 = (l / 2)\\omega \\rule{1em}{1pt} v_2 = v_1 to the left. The velocity of the pellet relative to the pendulum is reversed. If the pellet remains imbedded in the pendulum, the impulse is completely inelastic.

If the sheet is greasy, the contact angle is 180\\textdegree and the weight appears to be 3000 dynes. What is the surface tension of water?", "solution": "The contact angle \\texttheta is a measure of the curvature of the liquid surface adjacent to the metal sheet (see figure). In either case there are three forces acting on the sheet: the tension in the suspension which gives the apparent weight, the actual weight of the sheet, and the total surface- tension force. In the first case the angle of contact is zero and the surface tension force acts downward since it tries to restore the liquid to its original level. Thus since the sheet is in equilibrium F_1 = W + 2T, the factor 2 being necessary since thereare two sides to the sheet. In the second case the angle of contact is 180\\textdegree and thus the surface-tension force is acting upward. Hence F_2 = W - 2T.

{"question": "How does nutrient procurement by green plants differfrom thatof animals, fungi, andprotista?", "solution": "All green plants areautotrophs, subsisting exclusively on inorganic substancestaken from their en-vironment. The necessary molecules, being smalland soluble, are able to pass through cell membranes. Autotrophic organismstherefore do not need to digest their nutrients before taking theminto their cells. Green plants are photosynthetic, taking in carbon dioxideand water from their environment, and using the energy from sunlightto synthesize carbohydrates from them. 93% of the dry weight of plant was originally carbon dioxide in the air. Plants also need to synthesize proteins. Protein synthesis requires otherelements, such as nitrogen and sulfur. When rain water dissolves thesenutrients in the soil, the solution is taken up by the root system and transportedto various parts of the plant via the vascular system. Minerals requiredby plants are also transported up the plant body via the root and vascularsystems. Some plants supplement their protein diet by trapping insects(the Venus flytrap is an example). Many fungi such as mushroom, cannot produce their own carbohydratesfrom the air and water. They areheterotrophs: they must obtainthe carbohydrates they require from the surroundings. This is usuallysupplied by dead plant matter, but plant matter is mainly cellulose andother polysaccharides which must be first digested. Specialized secretorycells in these organisms release the enzymes for digestion into thesurrounding organic matter. The products of this extracellular digestion arethen directly absorbed through the cells surfaces or some-times by specializedabsorbing structures. Almost all animals are dependent on plant matter, or other animals thatfeed on plant matter, for food. They too areheterotrophs. Without plants, there would be virtually noheterotrophson earth. Like the mushroom, most animals digest the majority of their foodextracellularly. The simple products are then taken into the cells where they are further degradedby intracellular enzymes. Digestion is unimportant in green plantsbut fungi and animals have di-gestive process of the extracellular type. Protistaareautotrophsorheterotrophs.

{"question": "How would you define ecology?

The termautecologyrefers to studiesof individual organisms or populations, of single species and their interactionswith the environ-ment.Synecologyrefers to studies of various groupsof organisms which are associated to form a functional unit of the environment. Groups of organisms are characterized by three levels of organization- populations,communititesandecocystems. A population is agroup of organisms belonging to the same species which occupy a given area. A community is a unit composed of a group of populations living in a givenarea. The community and the physical environment considered togetheris an ecosystem. Each of these designations may be applied to a smalllocal entity or to a large widespread one. Thus a small group of sycamoretrees in a park may be regarded as a population, as could be thesycamore trees in the eastern United States. Similarly, a small pond andits inhabitants or the forest in which the pond is located may be treatedas an ecosystem. From these examples, we see that the limit of an ecosystemdepends on how we define our ecosystem.

Heat of fusion of H_2O = 80 cal/g, specific heat = 1 cal/g-\\textdegreeC.", "solution": "In a determination of this kind, the heat lost by the water in cooling must be balanced by the heat gained by the ice in melting and in warming the resulting water (fron the melted ice) to the final temperature. This means that the heat absorbed by the ice must equal the heat lost by the water at 60\\textdegreeC. The heat absorbed by the ice is the combination of the heat absorbed by the ice in melting and the heat absorbed by the cold water to the new temperature. The heat absorbed when the ice melts can be calculated by taking into account the heat of fusion. The heat of fusion is defined as the number of calories absorbed when 1 g of solid melts. For water, 80 calories are absorbed for each gram of ice melted. Here 40 g of ice is melted. Therefore, the amount of heat absorbed by the ice is 40 times the heat of fusion. 40 g \u00d7 80 cal/g = 3200 cal. As such, 3200 calories are absorbed when the ice melts. To find the amount of heat absorbed, when this water (from the melted ice) is heated to a new temperature, you must consider the specific heat of water. The specific heat is defined as the number of calories needed to raise 1 g of liquid 1 degree. The specific heat of water is 1, which means that for every gram of water raised 1 degree, 1 calorie is absorbed. In calculating the amount of heat absorbed by the water to the new temperature, let t = new temperature. To find the amount of heat absorbed, multply the specific heat by 40 g, because 40 g of water is present, and by the new temperature, t, because the water will be raised t degrees from zero. Amount of heat absorbed by liquid = 40 g \u00d7 1cal/g-degree)\u00d7 t = 40 t cal. Therefore, 40 t calories will be absorbed by the melted ice. Thus, the amount of heat absorbed by the ice when it melts, and by the water when it is heated, is equal to the total amount of heat absorbed by the system, Total amount of heat absorbed = 3200 cal + 40 t cal = (3200 + 40 t) cal. To find the amount of heat lost by the 100 g of water at 60\\textdegreeC, when it is cooled to a new temperature, t, the specific heat of water is also used. Here, it means that for every gram of water that is lowered one degree, 1 calorie of heat is released.

{"question": "Define the following terms as they relate to Polish string notation: a) infix b) prefix c) postfix Then, convert the following tree into the three types of expressions just defined.", "solution": "Infix notation refers to the way we normally write expressions, namely, with the operators between the two operands. This is also known as algebraic notation, which is different from Polish notation. Prefix notation refers to the fact that the operator precedes the expression in the string. So, if we have the string \\div XY, it means that the division operator acts to divide X by Y. One inconvenience with prefix notation is that to understand the string, you must read from end to beginning. Postfix notation avoids this difficulty. For the string above, postfix notation would be XY \\div. The meaning is the same as above, but the operator comes after the two operands. The infix translation of the tree diagram is then (P + Q) \u00d7 (R - S). This is obvious if you follow the tree up from the terminal nodes to the root node. Prefix translation yields x + PQ - RS.

R = 0.0821 liter-atm./mole\\textdegreeK.", "solution": "You are given the equilibrium constant for this reaction and asked to calculate the quantity of nitrosy1 bromide produced. The first step is to write out the equilibrium expression and equate it with the given value. For the general reaction , xA+yB\\rightarrowzC, K is defined[C]^2 / { [B]^y [A]^x } , where the brackets represent concentrations. For this reaction , K = [NOBr]^2/ { [NO]^2[Br_2 ] } = 100 . To find out how muchNOBris produced, you would have to know how many moles of NO and Br_2 were reacted. Once this is known, you can find the number of grams produced. You know that the equi-librium expression is based on concentration of reactants and prod-ucts. Concentration is expressed in moles per liter. This means that if the volume of theNOBrand its concentration is known, you can find moles, since concentration X volume (liters) = moles. Let us represent the concentration as (N / V) = (moles) / (Volume) . Thus, the equilibrium expression becomes K = [(N_NOBr/ V)^2] / [(N_NO / V)^2 (N_(Br)2 / V)]. Let x = moles ofNOBrformed. Then, x moles of NO and x/2molesof Br_2 are consumed, since the coefficients of the reaction show a 2:2:1 ratio amongNOBr:NO :Br_2 .

The type of food fed to the female larva determines whether it will develop into a worker or queen. A diet of \"royal jelly\" causes her to become a fertile queen . The work performed by a worker bee is determined by its age. For two weeks after metamorphosis, workers function as nurse bees, first incubating the brood and preparing brood cells, later feeding the larvae. Then the sterile females become house bees for one or two weeks, working as storekeepers, waxsecreters, or guards and cleaning the hive, or ventilating it by fanning their wings. The worker finally becomes a food gatherer for four or five .weeks, and collects nectar, pollen, and water. A queen bee soon after hatching mates several times with male drone bees. The queen accumulates enough sperm to last for her lifetime, and stores the sperm in-ternally in aspermatotheca. Thereafter shelays fertilized and unfertilized eggs, as many as a thousand a day. The drone dies after copulation; its reproductive organs literally explode into the female .

{"question": "What is reverse transcriptase and what is its function? How might it be used in cancer research?", "solution": "We have seen in protein synthesis that biological information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. This flow had become the rule until 1964, when Temin found that infection with certain RNA tumor viruses (can- cer- causing substances) is blocked by inhibitors of DNA synthesis and by inhibitors of DNA transcription. This suggested that DNA synthesis and transcription are re-quired for the multiplication of RNA tumor viruses. This would mean that the information carried by the RNA of the virus is first transferred to DNA, whereupon it is trans-cribed and translated, and consequently, that information flows in the reverse direction, that is, from RNA to DNA. Temin proposes that the RNA of these tumor viruses, in their replication, are able to form DNA. His hypothesis requires a new kind of enzyme - one that would catalyze the synthesis of DNA using RNA as a template. Such an enzyme was discovered by Temin and by Baltimore in 1970. This RNA - directed DNA polymerase, also known as re-verse transcriptase, has been found to be present in all RNA tumor viruses. An infecting RNA virus binds to and enters the host cell (the cell which the virus attacks). Once in the cytoplasm, the RNA genome is separated from its protein coat (see figure). Then, through an as yet unknown mechanism, the viral reverse transcriptase is used to form a DNA molecule using the viral RNA as a template. This DNA molecule is integrated into the host's chromoso-me, with a number of possible consequences. The viral DNA may now be duplicated along with the host's DNA, and its information thus propogated to all offspring of the infected cell. Its presence in the genome of the host may \"transform\" the cell and its offspring (cause them to become cancerous). In addition, the viral DNA may be used as a template for the synthesis of new viral RNA, and the virus thus multiplies itself and continues its infectious process, often without killing the cell. Because the viral genome is RNA, it cannot as such be integrated into the host's genome. Reverse transcriptase enables the virus to convert its genetic material to DNA, whereupon it is capable of inserting itself into the host chromosome. There are three reasons why reverse transcriptase is so important in cancer research. First, human leukemia sarcomas (different forms of cancer) have been shown to contain large RNA molecules similar to those of the tumor viruses that cause cancer in mice. Second, these human cancer cells contain particles with reverse transcriptase activity. Third, the DNA of some human cancer cells have virus-like sequences of nucleotides, sequences not found in the DNA of comparable normal cells. Since the action of RNA from tumor viruses depends on the presence of the enzyme reverse transcriptase, reseach into its chemical composition (amino acid' sequence) may bring better understanding of its function. The ultimate objective of such reseach would of course be the prevention of cancer, perhaps through the inhibition of reverse transcriptase activity.", "images": ["images/F24-0639_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F24-0639.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Reverse transcriptase is an RNA - directed DNA polymerase that catalyzes the synthesis of DNA using RNA as a template.

{"question": "The weight of the fruit in one variety of squash is determined by three pairs of genes.

What would be the weights of the F_2 fruit, if two of these F_1 plants were crossed?", "solution": "This problem deals with polygenic inheritance; that is, the situation in which two or more independent pairs of genes have similar and additive effects on the same characteristic. Examples of such inheritance are height and skin color in man, and commercially important characteristics in animals and plants, such as the amount of eggs and milk produced, the size of fruit, and so on. In the cross between a 6-pound squash plant and a 3-pound squash plant : We are told that each dominant gene adds (1/2) pound to the weight. The presence of 3 dominant genes in F_1 (A, B, and C) would increase the weight by (1/2) + (1/2) + (1/2) or 1 (1/2) lbs. Therefore each squash from F_1 weighs 3 + 1 (1/2)or4 (1/2) pounds. In the cross between two F_1 plants, we must first determine the possible gametes from each plant. The number of possible gametes is obtained using the 2^n rule, where n is the number of heterozygous traits and 2n is the total number of different gametes formed. For each parent, n is equal to 3. Therefore the number of gametes is 2^3 or 8. The genotypes of these gametes can be obtained by dichotomous branching, which ensures that all possible combinations are considered. Each possible gene from each allelic pair is matched to every possible gene combination of the other two pairs as follows : Gametes ABC B C ABc A c AbC b C Abc c aBC B C aBc a c abC b C abc c Looking at the cross : Separating the trihybrid cross into three monohybrid crosses, and then using dichotomous branching to determine all possible combinations of the results of these crosses, one obtains: Summarizing:1/64weighs 6 pounds Summarizing:1/64weighs 6 pounds 6/64weighs 51/2 pounds 15/64weighs 5 pounds 20/64weighs 41/2 pounds 15/64weighs 4 pounds 6/64weighs 31/2 pounds 1/64weighs 3 pounds It is important to be able to associate quantitative characteristics with polygenic inheritance.

{"question": "Artificial kidneys have been devised for patients with kidney disease. How do these artificial kidneys work? What is the basic principle involved?", "solution": "The artificial kidney is used to replace the diseased kidney in eliminating the excess ions and wastes which would accumulate in the blood as a result of failure of the latter. In an artificial kidney, the patient's blood is passed through a system of very fine tubes bounded by thin membranes. The other side of the membrane is bathed by a dialysis fluid into which waste products can pass from the blood. The fine tubes con-verge into a tubing which then conducts the blood back into the patient's body through a vein. The fine tubes of the artificial kidney are made of cellophane. This material is used because it has much the same characteristics as the endothelium of blood capillaries; it is highly permeable to most small solutes but relatively impermeable to protein. The dialysis fluid which bathes the cellophane tubes is a salt solution with ionic concentrations similar to those of blood plasma. The function of the artificial kidney can be ex-plained by the principle of diffusion. Since the cel-lophane membrane is permeable to most small solutes, the concentrations of solutes in the blood, as it flows through the tubes, tend to equal those in the dialysis fluid. However, if there is an above normal level of a certain solute in the blood, this solute will diffuse out of the blood into the surrounding fluid, which has a lower concentration of the solute. In this way, waste products and other fluid substances in excess will leave the blood and pass into the dialysis fluid since their concentrations in the fluid are very low or non-existent. To prevent waste solutes from building up in the fluid and inter-fering with diffusion, the fluid is continually being re-placed by fresh supply. Great care must be taken to maintain the sterility of the artificial kidney. The total amount of blood in an artificial kidney at any one moment is roughly 400-500 ml. Usually heparin, an anticoagulant, is added to the blood as it enters the artificial kidney to prevent coagulation; an antiheparinis added to the blood before returning it to the patient's body in order to allow normal blood clotting to take place. An artificial kidney can clear urea from the blood at a rate of about 200 ml. of plasma per minute, - that is, 200 ml of plasma can be completely cleared of urea in one minute - this being almost three times as fast as the clearance rate of both normal kidneys working together. Thus we can see that the artificial kidney can be very effective, but it can be used for only 12 hours every 3 or 4 days, because of the danger to the blood's clotting mechanisms due to the addition of heparin.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F18-0459.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The artificial kidney works by passing the patient's blood through a system of fine tubes bounded by thin membranes.

The timing diagram for the memory circuit is given in Figure 1; In general, the operation of the sequential circuit given may be completely defined by a state-table which lists all possible operating conditions, as shown in figure 2. The logic followed in the construction of the state-table is as follows: To fill in the upper left hand corner assume a present state y^k = 0 and the input x^k = 0. Following these signals through the combinational circuit it is found that the next state is y^k = 0 and that the output is j = 0. Hence the entry in the upper left; block is 0/0 . The initial conditions for the upper right block is y^k = 0, and x^k = 1. Applying these signals to the combina-tional circuit given yields the output j = 0. So that the entry in this block is 1/0. To obtain the completed state diagram the states which the circuit assumes must be identified. Identification may be done as follows: y = (0) \\equiv A y = (1) \\equiv B The completed state table is shown in Fig. 3: b) To construct the state diagram, the state table is used. Examination of the state table reveals that these are the only two states, A and B, which the circuit may assume. These states are represented in a state diagram as shown in figure 4. Note that assuming an initial state, y^k = 0 and x^k = 0, the output is zero and the next state is still A. When y^k = 0 and x^k = 1 the next state is the state B and the output is y = 0. When x^k = 0 is applied to state B the next state is again state B and output is y = 0. When x^k = 1 state B changes to state A with an output of j = 1.", "images": ["images/G04-0085_files/image002.jpg", "images/G04-0085_files/image004.jpg", "images/G04-0085_files/image006.jpg", "images/G04-0085_files/image008.jpg", "images/G04-0085_files/image010.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G04-0085.htm", "image_question": true, "image_answer": true, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The sequential circuit has only two states, A and B.

By how much is each wire stretched, and how much of the weight does each wire carry?

Hence two wires exert upward forces on the bar of magni-tude F_n, and one wire exerts a force of magnitude F'_n = [AY(\u22061 - 0.05 cm)]/[1_0 + 0.05 cm] Since the ratio 0.05/1_0 = .00025 is so small, we may ignore 0.05 in comparison with 1_0 in the denominator of the expression for F'_n.

{"question": "What is the meaning and significance of the Pauling electronegativity scale?", "solution": "In any chemical bond, electrons are shared between the bonding atoms. In covalent bonds, the valence electrons are shared almost equally - the shared electrons spend about the same amount of time with each atom. In ionic bonds, the valence electrons are monopolized by one atom. The degree to which a bond will be ionic or covalent is dependent upon the relative electron-attracting ability of the bonding atoms. The Paulingelectronegativityscale provides a measure for the relative electron-attracting abilities orelectronegativityof each element. The most electronegative element, fluorine, is assigned the highest number, 4.0. The least electron attracting elements (and consequently, those most willing to lose electrons), cesium and francium, are assigned the lowest number, 0.7. Numbers are assigned to the remaining elements so that no element has a higher number than an element more electronegative than it. Furthermore, the numbers are assigned so that the differ-ences between theelectronegativitiesof two elements is indicative of the ionic quality of the bond that forms between them. In particular, if the difference is 1.7 or greater, then the shared electrons are monopolized by the more electronegative atom to such a great extent that the bond is said to be ionic. If the difference is less than 1.7, the bond is covalent. Thus, when given a compound, the Paulingelectro-negativityscale can be used to determine the species that acts as the electron donor, the species that acts as the electron acceptor, and the degree of electron polarization of the bond.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E17-0622.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The Pauling electronegativity scale provides a measure for the relative electron-attracting abilities or electronegativity of each element."}
{"question": "What is the rotational inertia about an axis through the What is the rotational inertia about an axis through the center of a 25-kg solid sphere whose diameter is 0.30 m?", "solution": "For a rigid body rotating with angular speed \\omega about a fixed axis, the kinetic energy is K = (1/2) mv^2 = (1/2) m(\\omegar)^2. Each particle of this body can be considered as contributing to the total kinetic energy. The angular velocity, \\omega, of all the particles is the same, but their distance r from the axis of rotation varies. Therefore, the total kinetic energy can be written as K = (1/2) (m_1r^2_1 + m_2r^2_2 + ... ) \\omega^2 = (1/2)\\sum(m_ir^2_i)\\omega^2 where the summation is taken over all the particles in the rigid body. The rotational inertia, I, is defined as I = \\sum m_ir^2_i. As can be seen from the above equations, the ro-tational energy of a body, for a given angular speed \\omega, depends on the mass of the body and the way that mass is distributed around the axis of rotation. Since most rigid bodies are not composed of discrete point masses but are continuous distributions of matter, the summation for I in the above equation becomes an integration.

Upon inspection of the oxidation states of the periodic table, the equilibrium will be found to be PbS(s) \\rightleftarrows Pb^2+ (Aq) + S^2- (Aq) . The presence of the equilibrium derives from the fact that a saturated salt solution's ions will exist in equilibrium with any additional salt.

{"question": "What would be the simplest and safest reliable method of distinguishing between the following pairs of materials? (a) Water and rubbing alcohol. (b) Gasoline and kerosene, (c) Baking soda and baking powder.", "solution": "(a) Pour to a depth of about one-half inch of each compound into two separate test tubes. Cover each of the test tubes with your thumb and shake them vigorously. There will be an outward pressure on your thumb from the contents of one of the test tubes. This tube contains the rubbing alcohol. This pressure is called vapor pressure. It is proportional to the ability of a liquid to vaporize or evaporate. Vapor pressure is a measure of the physical property called volatility. Rubbing alcohol is more volatile than water and will have a greater vapor pressure and lower boiling point. (b) Gasoline and kerosene are both products of the distillation of crude oil. Distillation is a process used to separate mixtures of liquids. When a liquid is distilled it is boiled in a round bottomed container at the end of a glass enclosed tube. The various compounds in the mixture burn at their own distinctive boiling points. Thus, first the lowest boiling substance will boil and evaporate, then as the mixture becomes hotter the next lowest and so on until no compounds are left in the container. As each com-pound boils its vapors enter the tube or column where they are condensed and eventually collected. A different vessel is used to collect each fraction with a distinct boiling point and hence the mixture becomes separated into its various components. The more times a fraction is distilled the more pure a sample made. This is the best method for separating gasoline and kerosene. Gasoline burns over a range from 40\\textdegree to 200\\textdegreeC and kerosene from 175\\textdegree to 275\\textdegreeC. They can be easily separated by distillation. The accompany-ing figure shows a fractional distillation of crude oil. (c) The difference between baking soda and baking powder is that baking soda is a compound and baking powder is a mixture. A compound is a homogeneous substance composed of two or more elements, the proportions of which are fixed and invariable by weight. A mixture is a substance made of two or more elements or compounds in a nonhomogeneous combination. Under a magnifying glass or microscope one will not be able to distinguish the components of a compound whereas one can readily identify the components of a mix-ture.

{"question": "How is the Golgi apparatus related to the endoplasmic reticulum in function ?", "solution": "The Golgi apparatus is composed of several membrane-bounded, flattened sacs or cisternae arranged in parallel array about 300 \\AA apart (see Figure 1) . The sacs are disc-like and often slightly curved. Note the concavity on the trans face near the plasma membrane and the convexity of the cis face are thinner (more like reticulum membrane than like plasma membrane). The function of the Golgi apparatus is best understood in cells involved in protein synthesis and secretion. The protein to be secreted is synthesised on the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Vesicles containing small quan-tities of the synthesized protein bud off from the endplasmic reticulum. These vesicles carry the protein to the convex face of the Goldi complex. In the Goldi appar-atus, the protein is concentrated by the removal of water. In addition, chemical modifications of the protein, such as glycosylation (addition of sugar) occur. The modified protein is released from the concave surface in the form of secretory granules. The secretory granules containing the protein are from the cytoplasm by a membrane that can fuse with the plasma membrane, its content (protein in this case) is expelled from the cell, a process known as excytosis. This process is outlined in Figure 2. Most of the cell organelles are found in a specific arrangement within the cell to complement their function. For example, the Golgi apparatus is usually found near the cell membrane and is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum.

{"question": "What are the characteristics of ecological succession?", "solution": "Succession is a fairly orderly process of changes of communities in aregion. It involves replace-ment, in the course of time, of the dominant specieswithin a given area by other species. Communities succeed each otherin an orderly sequence in which each successive stage is thought to bedependent on the one which preceded it. Each community in the successionis called aseralstage. The first stage of succession is usually the colonization of barren spacesuch as a sandy beach or a rock, by simple pioneer species such asgrasses. The pioneer species are able to grow and breed rapidly. They haveadopted the strategy of finding and utilizing empty space. Then, graduallythe pioneers are replaced by more complex and bulky species untilfinally the community is characterized by climax species which representthe final stage of succession. Climax commu-nities are the most stableand will only if some outside agent such as new species or a geographicchange dis-places them. Most succession can be classified into eitherprimary or secondary successions. Primary successions proceed by pioneeringnew uninhabited sites. Secondary successions occur on disturbedland where a climax community that existed before had been destroyedby such occurrences as fire, severe wind storms, flooding and landslides. Although succession in different places and at different times is not identical(the species involved are often completely different) some ecologistshave nevertheless formulated generalizations that hold true for mostcases where bothautotrophsandheterotrophsare involved: 1) The species composition changes continuously during the succession, but the change is usually more rapid in the earlier stages than inthe later ones. 2) The total number of species represented increases initiallyand then becomes fairly stabilized in the older stages. This is particularlytrue of theheterotrophs, whose variety is usually much greater inthe later stages of the succession. 3) Both the total biomass in the ecosystemand the amount of nonliving organic matter increase during the successionuntil a more stable stage is reached. 4) The food webs becomemore complex, and the relations between species in them becomebetter defined. 5) Although the amount of new organic matter synthesizedby the producers remains approximately the same, except at thebeginning of suc-cession, the percentage utilized at the varioustrophic levelsrises.

{"question": "Describe the path of a molecule of sugar from the time it entersthe mouth as part of a molecule of starch, until it reachesthe cytoplasm of the cells lining the small intestine.", "solution": "Upon entering the mouth, the starch is chewed and mixed with saliva. The saliva dissolves small molecules and coats the larger clumps ofstarch with a solution of the enzyme amylase. As the mass of food is swallowed, the enzyme amylase from the saliva hydrolyzes the starch, degradingit into maltose units. Maltose is a disaccharide composed of two glucosemolecules. Eventually, the acidity of the stomach inhibits the actionsof the salivary amylase, leaving most of the starch undigested. No furtherdigestion of the starch occurs until it reaches the small intestine. There, pancreatic amylase finishes the cleavage of starch into maltose. Intestinal maltase then hydrolyzes the maltose moleculesinto two glucose moleculeseach. Other intestinal enzymes cleave other disaccharides, suchas sucrose, intomonosaccharides.

The nervous system functions in such a way that when a given receptor is stimulated, the proper effector responds appropriately. The chief functions of the nervous system are the conduction of impulses and the integration of the activities of various parts of the body. Integration means a putting together of generally dissimilar things to achieve unity. Other systems involved in similar functions are the endocrine system and the regulatory controls intrinsic in the enzyme systems within each cell.

{"question": "The ease of formation of carbonium ions is 3\\textdegree>2\\textdegree>1\\textdegree>Ch_3+. Explain why.", "solution": "A carbonium ion is a group of atoms containing a carbon atom with only six electrons around it. Thus the carbonium ion is positively charged. The carbonium ions are classified as primary (1\\textdegree), secondary (2\\textdegree), and tertiary (3\\textdegree) after the carbon bearing the positive charge. For example, where R can be any alkyl group. To understand why the ease of formation is 3\\textdegree>2\\textdegree>1\\textdegree>CH_3+, you need to understand some of the proper-ties of a charged system. According to the laws of electrostatics, the stability of a charged system is in-creased by the distribution of the charge. Alkyl groups, for example, tend to donate electrons, so that any positive charge is dispersed. Thus, the more alkyl groups donating electrons, the greater the distribution of positive charges in a carbonium ion, and, as such, the more stable it is. The greater the stability of a substance, the easier it is to form. In our example, the 3\\textdegree carbonium ion has 3 alkyl groups, the 2\\textdegree ion has 2 alkyl groups, and the 1\\textdegree ion has one alkyl group.

{"question": "There are three processes which together enable the kidney to remove wastes while conserving the useful components of the blood. What are these processes and where do they occur?", "solution": "Blood flowing to the kidneys first undergoes glomerular filtration. This occurs at the junction of the glomerular capillaries and the wall of Bowman's capsule. The blood plasma is filtered as it passes through the capillaries, which are freely permeable to water and solutes of small molecular dimension yet relatively im-permeable to large molecules, especially the plasma pro-teins. Water, salts, glucose, urea and other small species pass from the blood into the cavity of Bowman's capsule to become the glomerular filtrate. It has been demonstrated that the filtrate in Bowman's capsule contains virtually no protein and that all low weight crystalloids (glucose, protons, chloride ions, etc.) are present in the same concentrations as in plasma. If it were not for the process of tubularreabsorption, the composition of the urine would be identical to that of the glomerular filtrate. This would be extremely wasteful, since a great deal of water, glucose, amino acids and other useful substances present in the filtrate would be lost. Tubular reabsorption is strictly defined as the transfer of material from the tubular lumen back to the blood through the walls of the capillary network in intimate contact with the tubule. The principal portion of the tubule involved in reabsorption is the proximal convoluted tubule. This tubule is lined with epithelial cells having many hair-like processes extending into its lumen. These processes sure the chief sites of tubular reabsorption. As the filtrate passes through the tubule, the epithelial cells reabsorb much of the water and virtually all the glucose, amino acids and other substances useful to the body. The cells then secrete these back into the blood-stream. The secretion of these substances into the blood is accomplished against a concentration gradient, and is thus an energy consuming process - one utilizing ATP. The rates at which substances are reabsorbed, and therefore the rates at which wastes are excreted (because what is not re-absorbed is eliminated), are constantly subjected to physiological control. The ability to vary the excretion of water, sodium, potassium, hydrogen, calcium, and phos-phate ions, and many other substances is the essence of the kidney's ability to regulate the internal environment. Reabsorption also occurs in the distal convoluted tubules, where sodium is actively reabsorbed under the influence of aldosterone, a hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex. When this occurs, chloride passively follows due to an electrical gradient; water is also reabsorbed because of an osmotic gradient established by the reabsorption of sodium and chloride. In addition, reabsorption of water takes place in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct, stimulated by the posterior pituitary hormone vaso-pressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH) . ADH in-creases the permeability of the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct to water, allowing water to leave the lumen of the nephron and render the urine more concentrated. The kidney also removes wastes by means of tubular secretion. This process involves the movement of addi-tional waste materials directly from the bloodstream into the lumen of the tubules, without passing through Bowman's capsule. Tubular secretion may be either active or passive, that is, it may or may not require energy. Of the large num-ber of different substances transported into the tubules by tubular secretion, only a few are normally found in the body. The most important of these are potassium and hydrogen ions. Most other substances secreted are foreign substances, such as penicillin. In some animals, like the toadfish, whose kidneys lack glomeruli and Bowman's capsules, secre-tion by the tubules is the only method available for excre-tion.", "images": ["images/F18-0444_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F18-0444.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The three processes are glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion.

{"question": "Certain connoisseurs can recognize hundreds of varieties of wine by tasting small samples. How is this possible when there are only four types of taste receptors?", "solution": "Taste buds on the tongue and the soft palate are the organs of taste in human beings. Each taste bud contains supportive cells as well as epithelial cells which function as receptors. These epithelial cells have numerous microvilli that are exposed on the tongue surface. Each receptor is innervated by one or more neurons, and when a receptor is excited, it genera-tes impulses in the neurons. There are four basic taste senses: sweet, sour, bitter, and salty. The receptors for each of these four basic tastes are con-centrated in different regions of the tongue-sweet and saltly on the front, bitter on the back, and sour on the sides (see Figure). The sensitivity of these four regions on the tongue to the four different tastes can be demonstrated by placing solutions with various tastes on each region. A dry tongue is insensitive to taste. Few substances stimulate only one of the four kinds of receptors, but most stimulate two or more types in varying degrees. The common taste sensations we ex-perience daily are created by combinations of the four basic tastes in different relative intensities. Moreover, taste does not depend on the perception of the receptors in the taste buds alone. Olfaction plays an important role in the sense of taste. Together they help us distinguish an enormous number of different tastes. We can now understand how a connoisseur, using a combination of his taste buds and his sense of smell, can recognize hundreds of varieties of wine.", "images": ["images/F20-0499_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F20-0499.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "A connoisseur, using a combination of his taste buds and his sense of smell, can recognize hundreds of varieties of wine."}
{"question": "Discuss the chemical composition of DNA.", "solution": "Deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA is one type of nucleic acid present in the nucleus of all cells.

There are four kinds of nitrogenous bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. Adenine, and guanine belong to the class of organic compounds called purines, and cytosine and thymine belong to the pyrimidines.

{"question": "Describe and compare the different forms of currently used methods of contraception. Discuss the safety and efficiency of each.", "solution": "Reproduction in man is an extremely complex process involving many different events. Contraception or birth control acts on the principle that these events are sequential; preventing any given event from occurring will prevent the end result, which is pregnancy. The currently used methods of birth control interfere with the normal reproductive process by (1) suppressing the formation and/or release of gametes; (2) preventing the union of gametes in fertilization; or (3) preventing implantation of the fertilized egg. The oral contraceptive or \"pill\" acts to prevent ovulation in the female. The pill contains combinations of estrogen and progesterone, which inhibit the release of FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone) by the pituitary via a feedback mechanism; these hormones respectively stimulate follicular growth and trigger ovulation. A woman who is taking the pill in-hibits their release and does not ovulate. The pill is usually taken daily from the fifth to the twenty-fifth day of the female cycle. Withdrawal of the first five days triggers menstruation. Some synthetic hormones used in oral contraception have additional antifertility effects in that they cause a thickening of the cervical mucus and as a result, sperm have more difficulty entering the uterus. The effects of long-term use of the pill are not yet known. There does exist a relationship between increased amounts of estrogen and a higher risk of thromboembolism (the formation of blood clots). Presently, the efficiency of the oral contraceptive is close to 100%. Women using the pill have between zero and one pregnancy per hundred woman-years (a group of one hundred women using that method of contraception for one year). Fifty to eighty pregnancies per hungred woman-years will occur if no attempt is made to restrict conception. Condoms and diaphragms interpose a barrier between the male and female gametes. A condom prevents semen from entering the vagina. A diaphragm blocks the cervix and prevents sperm entry into the uterus. Spermicidal jellies and foams are used with the diaphragm to kill sperm. Condoms and diaphragms are relatively safe, and their effi-ciency results in about 12 to 14 pregnancies per hundred woman-years. The intrauterine device or IUD prevents the implan-tation of the fertilized egg. The IUD is a small object, such as a coil, placed within the uterus, which causes a slight local inflammatory response in the endometrium. This interferes with the endometrial preparation for proper implantation of the blastocyst. In some women, the IUD causes severe cramping and is sometimes spontaneously expelled. Its efficiency is about two pregnancies per hundred woman-years. Restricting intercourse to a \"safe\" period is known as the rhythm method. Normally, a woman ovulates once a month and abstaining from intercourse during this time can be used as a form of contraception. However, it is extremely diff-icult to precisely determine when ovulation occurs, even when taking body temperature daily (the body temperature rises slighlty following ovulation). Therefore this method is not a very reliable method. About twenty-four pregnancies per hundred woman-years occur using the rhythm method. A more permanent form of birth control is sterilization. In females, this is accomplished by tubal ligation, an operation in which the Fallopian tubes are cut and tied, preventing passage of the ovum from the ovaries to the uterus. This method is 100% effective if performed properly, but involves obvious surgical risks. Male sterilization involves a vasectomy, the cutting and tying off of the vas deferens. Again, if done properly, it is 100% effective and does not involve complicated surgery or anesthesia. The development of the vasectomy marks the beginning of the search for effective male contraceptive techniques.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F22-0587.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The currently used methods of birth control interfere with the normal reproductive process by suppressing the formation and/or release of gametes, preventing the union of gametes in fertilization, or preventing implantation of the fertilized egg."}
{"question": "Calculate the wavelength of the first line in the visible (Balmer) series of the hydrogen spectrum, for which the electron transition is from orbit 3 to orbit 2.", "solution": "The total energy of the nth orbit of the hydrogen atom is given by E_n = - (1/2) K (e^2/r_n) wherer_n= n^2 r_1, r_1 being the first Bohr radius. If an electron jumps from a higher orbit to a lower orbit, it will emit photons (electromagnetic waves) because it has to decrease its energy to match the binding energy of the new orbit. Therefore, the energy carried away by radiation is equal to the difference between the two energy levels E^ph = E(n)1- E_(n)1 = - (1/2) k (e^2/r_1)[(1/n^2_1) - (1/n^2_1)]. where n_1 and n_2 denote the initial and final energy levels.

{"question": "NAD+ and NADP+ play important roles in reactions associated with metabolism. Discuss these roles.", "solution": "In a dehydrogenation reaction, the electrons removed from a substance cannot exist freely but must be transferred to another compound called an electron acceptor. Both nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) are electron aceeptors. The functional part of both NAD+ and NADP+ is the nicotinamide ring, which accepts one hydrogen atom and two electrons to become NADH and NADPH respectively NAD+ and NADP+ serve as electron acceptors in the dehydrogenation of substances with the secondary alcohol arangement. Although NADP+ only differs from NAD+ in having three rather than two phosphate groups on the R group, most dehydrogenases require either NAD+ or NADP+ to be present as a coenzyme and will not operate with the other one. NAD+ is used as an electron acceptor in glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and fatty acid oxidation. NADP+ is used as an electron acceptor in the light reaction of photo-synthesis, and in the pentose phosphate pathway (the source of pentoses, necessary constituents of nucleotides). We thus see that the function of NAD+ or NADP+ is to accept hydrogen atoms and electrons and to store energy released from oxidized substances in the form of NADH or NADH. The reverse is true for NADH or NADPH; that is, their function is to give up hydrogen atoms and electrons and energy to reducible compounds. For example, the hy-drogen atoms of NADH in the electron transport chain are ultimately transferred to oxygen, producing high energy phosphate bonds in the form of ATP along the chain. The oxidation of one molecule of NADH yields 3 phosphate bonds; thus the 8 NADHs produced in the TCA cycle yield 24 phos-phate bonds. NADPH is formed from the reduction of NADP+ in the light reaction of photosynthesis. It is subsequently utilized in the dark reactions of carbohydrate synthesis, in which carbon dioxide is used in the production of hexose molecules. To produce one hexose molecule (a 6-carbon sugar) , 12 NADPH and 18 ATP are required, both of which are the products of the light reactions. Thus, both NAD+, NADH and NADP+, NADPH have major importance in reactions associated with metabolic and catabolic functions.", "images": ["images/F03-0086_files/image002.jpg", "images/F03-0086_files/image004.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F03-0086.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "NAD+ and NADP+ serve as electron acceptors in dehydrogenation reactions, storing energy released from oxidized substances in the form of NADH or NADPH.

{"question": "What is the available energy for the \\alpha decay of Po^210 ?", "solution": "Some unstable nuclei, especially those with mass numbers above 200, spontaneously emit helium nuclei (\\alpha particles).

{"question": "If antibodies can be brought into contact with a virus before it attaches itself to the host cell, the virus will be inactivated. Once infection has occurred, the production of interferon may protect the host from ex-tensive tissue destruction. Explain.", "solution": "Many human diseases have a viral etiology (cause). Among the more common viral diseases are smallpox, chicken pox, mumps, measles, yellow fever, influenza, rabies, poliomyelitis, viral pneumonia, fever blisters (coldsores), and the common cold. Although most viral infections do not respond to treatment with many of the drugs effective against bacterial infection , many are preventable by means of vaccines. Buildup of an adequate supply of antibodies requires some time. During this period, extensive viral infection may occur. Most recoveries from viral diseases occur before full development of the immune response (productionof antibodies). A factor that is important in the recovery from a viral infection is interferon. Interferon is a protein produced by virus- infected cells, which spreads to uninfected cells and makes them more resistant to viral infection. Thus, extensive viral production and resultant tissue damage are prevented. Upon infection, the host cell is induced to syn-thesize interferon, a small protein which is then released into the extracellular fluid and affects the surrounding cells. Interferon binds to surface receptors of uninfected cells . This triggers these cells to synthesize acyto-plasmicenzyme which prevents viral multiplication. Note that the antiviral protein does notprevent entrance of the viral nucleic acid. Interferon produced by a cell infected with a particular virus can prevent healthy cells from becoming infected by almost all other types of viruses . Inter-feron is therefore not virus-specific. However, inter-feron produced by one host species is not effective if ad-ministered to a different species . It is therefore host species specific. Since interferon produced by birds and other mammals cannot be used in treating human beings, it is difficult to obtain large enough quantities of inter-feron to provide effective chemotherapy for viral diseases. (Human donors cannot provide the needed amount of inter-feron.) Interferon is a more rapid response to viral infection than antibody response . Interferon production is initiated within hours after viral infection, reaching a maximum after two days. Within three or four days, interferon production declines as antibodies are produced. Prevention of viral infection by interferon production must be distinguished from another phenomenon - viral interference. Viral interference is observed when an initial viral infection prevents a secondary infection of the same cell by a different virus. The initial virus somehow prevents reproduction of the second virus or inactivates re- ceptors on the cell membrane (there are specific sites for viral attachment ). It may also stimulate production of an inhibitor of the second virus . Viral interference does not prevent uninfected cells from becoming infected . Vaccinationinvolesadministration of an atten-uated (live, yet weakened ) or inactivated strain of virus (or other microorganism), which cannot produce the disease, but which stimulates antibody production and thus prevents infection by the pathogen.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F05-0156.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Interferon is a protein produced by virus-infected cells, which spreads to uninfected cells and makes them more resistant to viral infection.

CHARS SPAN(' ') NEXTCARD = INPUT: F(END) LOOPCARD STRING = CHARS ' ; ': S(LOOP) PUNCH = CARD: (NEXT) END The first line, &ANCHOR = 1; &TRIM = 1, introduces two new features of the SNOBOL IV language. First, it includes two separate statements. SNOBOL IV permits reordering of the several statements on one line, where each statement (except the last) ends with semicolon. Second, the first line introduces a new keyword &ANCH0R. If not otherwise specified, the initial value of &ANCH0R is zero, meaning that any pattern matching in that program will succeed whenever a pattern occurs anywhere in the subject. If the value of &ANCH0R is not zero, any pattern matching will succeed only if a pattern occurs in the beginning of the subject. Thus, in the previous problem, the two statements W0RD1LEN(1) . K K'K': F(START) could be replaced by &ANCH0R = 1 W0RD1'K': F(START) The second line includes BREAK and SPAN, the primitive functions whose values are pattern structures that match runs of characters. Patterns described by A RUN OF BLANKS, A STRING OF DIGITS, A WORD (RUN OF LETTERS) can be formed using SPAN as SPAN (' ') SPAN ('0123456789') SPAN ('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ') respectively. Patterns described by i) Everything up to the next blank, ii) Everything up to the next punctuation mark, iii) Everything up to the next number, can be formed using BREAK as BREAK (' ') BREAK (',.;:.'?') BREAK ('+-0123456789') respectively. The pattern structure for SPAN matches the longest string that consists solely of characters, appearing in the argument. BREAK generates a pattern structure that matches the string up to, but not including, the break character in the argument. Thus, the second line of this program indicates that the variable STRING will be assigned a first matched string of characters up to a first blank (the same string will also be assigned to CHARS), concatenated with the run of blanks between it and the next string. The third line of the program reads in a first input card. The fourth line assigns the first string of the card up to a blank, concatenated with the run of blanks following it, to STRING and substitutes it by the same string, only now followed by a semicolon, rather than blanks. Then it takes the next string and run of blanks and does the same. The procedure repeats until all the strings on the card are substituted. Then the computer punches out the first card with the proper changes, goes back to the third line (labeled NEXT), reads in the next card, and performs the needed substitutions on it. The control exits from the loop and terminates the program when there are no more cards in the input.

{"question": "CO_2 + H_2O +hv(light energy) (CH_2O) + O_2. It was generally assumed in the past that the carbohydrate came from a combination of the carbon atoms and water molecules and that the oxygen was released from the carbon dioxide molecule. Do you agree with this assumption? Explain your answer.", "solution": "Superficially, the assumption appears sound, and was believed for years to be true. It is however, quite wrong, and was refuted in the 1930's by C.B. vanNielof Stanford University. VanNielwas studying photosynthesis in different types of photosynthetic bacteria. He observed that in their photosynthetic reactions, bacteria reduce carbon dioxide to carbohydrate, but do not release oxygen. The purple sulfur bacteria, which require hydrogen sulfide for photosynthesis, were found to accumulate globules of sulfur within the cells. Based on these observations VanNiel then wrote the following equation for photosynthesis in purple sulfur bacteria: CO_2 + 2H_2S \\rightarrow CH_2O + H_2O + 2S This equation shows that it is unlikely that carbon dioxide is split during photosynthesis; if it were, oxygen would be formed. Moreover, carbohydrate could not have come from the combination of carbon atoms and hydrogen sulfide molecules. It would be reasonable to propose that hydrogen sulfide was the molecule to be cleaved rather than carbon dioxide. This led VanNielto propose the following general equation for photosynthesis, CO_2 + 2H_2A \\rightarrow (CH_2O) + H_2O + 2A Here, H_2A represents anoxidizablespecies capable of donating its electrons upon being split. According to this hypothesis, in the photosynthesis of green plants, it is the water molecule, not carbon dioxide, that is split to release O_2. This brilliant speculation was not proven until many years later when advancement of radio - isotopic techniques made it possible to reveal the mechanism of the actual reaction. The use of isotopic oxygen, ^18O, allowed the successful tracing of the path of oxygen from water to free molecular oxygen: CO_2 + 2H_2^18O - CH_2O + H_2O + ^18O_2 Thus, it can readily be seen that molecular oxygen comes actually from water and not from carbon dioxide. It is now known that the splitting of water occurs during the light reactions of photosynthesis, releasing O_2 gas, electrons, which are energized by light to provide for ATP formation, and protons, which are used to form NADPH, the reducing power necessary for carbohydrate formation. Carbon dioxide is then reduced in the dark reactions of photosynthesis using both ATP and NADPH to form carbohy-drates.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F09-0216.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Molecular oxygen comes actually from water and not from carbon dioxide."}

This is a measure of the ratio between the concentrations of products to reactants, each raised to the power of their respective coefficients in the chemical equation. (a) For this reaction, the equilibrium constant, K_a = {[CICH_2COO^-][H_3O^+]}/[CICH_2COOH] .Because K_a = 1.35 \u00d7 10^-3 , 1.35 \u00d7 10^-3 = {[CICH_2COO^-][H_3O^+]}/[CICH_2COOH] . Letting x = [H_3O^+] at equilibrium, then CICH_2COO^- = x since the reaction shows that the products are formed inequimolaramounts. The original concentration of the CICH_2COOH = 0.1 M. If x moles of H_3O^+ and x moles of CICH_2COO^- form, then, at equilibrium, there are 0.1 - x moles of CICH_2COO^- left. Substituting these variables into the equilibrium constant expression: [(x \\textbullet x)/(0.1 - x)] = 1.35 \u00d7 10^-3 . Solving for x,x = 0.0110 M. (b) If the dissociated acid is negligible with respect to the amount leftundissociated, then 0.1 - x (from pre-vious part) is equal to 0.1. This means that [(x \\textbullet x)/(0.1)] = 1.35 \u00d7 10^-3 . Solving for x;x = 0.0116 M = [H_3O^+]. This means that when you make this assumption, [H_3O^+] = 0.0116 M instead of 0.0110 M, the percent error is over 5 %. The error is too high and, therefore, this assumption cannot be made. To answer (c), compare the [H_3O^+] in acetic acid solution of 1.0 M with that of the [H_3O^+] calculated in part (a) . [H_3O^+] for acetic acid is calculated by using the same procedure as in part (a), except that K_a = 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5 and the dissociation equation is HOAC + H_2O \\rightleftarrows OAC^- + H_3O^+ .

Thus, the ClCH_2COOH has 8.27 times the H_3O^+ concentration of CH_2COOH (acetic acid), and is therefore more acidic.

{"question": "Explain the mechanism of the genetic determination of sex in man .", "solution": "The sex chromosomes are an exception to the general rule that the members of a pair of chromosomes are identical in size and shape and carry allelic pairs. The sex chromosomes are not homologous chromosomes . In man, the cells of females contain two identicalsex chromosomes or X chromosomes. In males there is only one X chromosome and a smaller Y chromosome with which the X pairs during meiotic synapsis. Men have 22 pairs of ordinary chromosomes (autosomes), plus one X and one Y chromosome, and women have 22 pairs ofautosomesplus two X chromosomes. Thus it is the presence of the Y chromosome which determines that an individual will be male. Although the mechanism is quite complex, we know that the presence of the Y chromosome stimulates thegonadal medulla , or sex-organ forming portion of the egg; to develop into male gonads , or sex-organs. In theabscenceof the Y chromosome, and in the presence of two X chromo-somes, the medulla develops into female gametes . [Note, that a full complement of two X chromosomes are needed for normal female development.] In man, since the male has one X and one Y chromosome, two types of sperm, or male gametes, are produced during spermatogenesis (theprocess of sperm formation, which includes meiosis) One half of the sperm population contains an X chromosome and the other half contains a Y chromosome. Each egg, or female gamete, contains a single X chromosome . This is because a female has only X chromo-somes, and meiosis produces only gametes with X chromo-somes. Fertilization of the X-bearing egg by an X-bearing sperm results in an XX, or female offspring . The ferti-lization of an X-bearing egg byaY-bearing sperm results in an XY, or male offspring. Since there are approximately equal numbers of X- and Y- bearing sperm, the numbers of boys and girls born in a population are nearly equal.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F25-0665.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The presence of the Y chromosome determines that an individual will be male."}

{"question": "Define the following terms, making clear the distinctions between them:a) Bitb) Bytec) Word.", "solution": "a) The bit is the most elementary data unit that corresponds to a binary digit in computer's memory. Generally the binary 1 is represented as high voltage and binary 0 is represented as low or negative voltage in a digital computer's registers and memory. However, this also depends on the nature of media. For example, on magnetic disks and tape reels, the bit is stored as traces of magnetism. The bit is also typically used to measure the rate at which data is transmitted over communica-tion media (e.g. twisted copper wire, coaxial cable, air, etc). A kilobit per second is one thousand bits per second, a megabit per second is one million bits per second. As of 1990, we do not yet speak of gigabits per second since there are no medium over which that high a communication rate can be achieved. b) The byte is a group of 8 bits. A byte may represent ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) char-acters or numbers in the computer. Byte is the basic unit for expressing storage capacities in computers. A kilobyte is a thousand bytes, a megabyte is a million bytes, and a gigabyte is one billion bytes. c) The word is less well defined. Its definition is depen-dent upon the hardware architecture of the computer. In general, the term \"word\" is used to indicate the length of registers and addressable memory locations. If the computer has an 8-bit pro-cessor (CPU), such as INTEL 8080A, then the word is 8 bits. If the computer has a 16-bit processor, such as PDP-11, then the word is 16 bits. Finally, if the computer has a 32-bit proces-sor, then the word is 32 bits. The term \"word\", other than indi-cating the smallest addressable units in a computer's memory, is not a very useful measure since it is not well defined.

{"question": "Explain how an estimate of the age of a rock is made on the basisof the radioactive elements present.", "solution": "Certain radioactive elements are spon-taneously transformed into otherelements at rates which are slow and essentially unaffected by externalfactors, such as the temperatures and pressures to which the elementsare subjected. The transformation, or decay, of each individual elementtakes place at a rate which can be measured. For example, half ofa given sample of the element uranium will be converted into lead in 4.5 billionyears. Thus, 4.5 billion years is the half-life of uranium. By measuringthe proportion of uranium and lead in a given rock, we can estimatewith a high degree of accuracy the absolute age of the rock. For instance, assume we determine that the ratio of uranium to lead in a given sampleis 1:1. We know, that the rock has existed long enough for half of theoriginal amount of uranium to be converted into lead, or a total of 4.5 billionyears, which is equal to one half-life of uranium. If the ratio is 1:3, three-fourths of the original amount of uranium is now lead, and one-fourth remains. Therefore, two half- lives must have passed, and half of the uraniumremaining after one half-life has turned into lead [(1/2) \u00d7 (1/4)X = (1/4) X, where x equals the original amount of uranium in thesample ]. Two half-lives are equivalent to a time period of 9 (= 2 \u00d7 4.5) billion years, and the age of the rock, then, is 9 billion years. Other methods are used to determine the age of rocks which are notold enough to use the uranium - leadmetodof dating. One of these is thepotassium 40 - argon (K40 -Ar) method. Potassium - 40 decays into argonand has a half-life of 1.3 billion years. Because these two elements arecommonly found in volcanic rock, this method is particularly useful in areaswhere volcanic activity is known to have occurred in the past.

{"question": "Write possible sets of quantum numbers for electrons in the second main energy level.", "solution": "In wave mechanical theory, four quantum numbers are needed to describe the electrons of an atom. The first or principal quantum number, n, designates the main energy level of the electron and has integral values of 1, 2, 3, ... . The second quantum number, l, designates the energy sublevel within the main energy level. The values of l depend upon the value of n and range from zero to n - 1. The third quantum number,m_l, designates the particular orbital within the energy sublevel. The number of orbitals of a given kind per energy sublevel is equal to the number ofm_l values (2l + 1) . The quantum numberm_lcan have any integral value from + l to - l including zero. The fourth quantum number, s, describes the two ways in which an electron may be aligned with a magnetic field (+ 1/2 or - 1/2). The states of the electrons within atoms are described by four quantum numbers, n, l,m_l, s. Another important factor is the Pauli exclusion principle which states that no two electrons within the same atom may have the same four quantum numbers. To solve this problem one must use the principles of assigning electrons to theirorbitals. If n = 2; l can then have the values 0, 1;m_lcan have the values of + 1, 0 or - 1, and s is always + 1/2 or - 1/2.

{"question": "What is the advantage of using DMA? When is DMA used?", "solution": "Computers with the DMA (direct memory access) feature have a direct link between the memory section and the I/O section. Thus, data can be transmitted to and from peripherals without intervention by the CPU. The advantage of using DMA is that the time to transfer data is limited only by the memory access time (usually less than one microsecond). Data transfer to the CPU of a computer without DMA requires several instruction cycles and takes ten to twenty times longer. Figure 1 shows the connections required for direct memory access. The DMA controller located in the I/O section handles data transfers just like the CPU. The \"DMA request\" control signal ensures that the CPU retains control of memory usage.

{"question": "It is observed that the chemical transmission occurring at a synapse is unidirectional that is, the neurotransmitter always travels from thepresynapticaxon to the post-synaptic dendrite . Explain why.", "solution": "Because there are physical separations (synaptic clefts) between neurons , an impulse traveling down the axon of one neuron must first be converted from an electrical form into a chemical form at the synapse, which can diffuse across the physical separation. This chemical form of transmission utilizes a chemical substance secreted by thepresynaptic axon terminal, known as a neurotransmitter. This neurotransmitter has the ability of changing the permeability properties of the post-synaptic cell membrane , causing it to depolarize and an action potential to be generated . The action potential then propagates down the axon of the postsynaptic neuron, forming a wave of depolarization. This new impulse, when it reaches the axon terminal, again can induce a neuro-transmitter to be released at the new synapse, and sub-sequently another neuron can be excited . Hence, by this mechanism, there can be continuous conveyance of neural passages by neurons, despite the presence of physical disconnections between them. The chemical transmission that occurs at a synapse is unidirectional since the neurotransmitter is present in the axonal end of a neuron only. This chemical is contained within small, sac-like structures called synaptic vesicles. The synaptic vesicles fuse with the membrane of the axon, induced by an electric impulse that reaches the axon terminal. They then break open, discharging the contents into the synaptic cleft. Because of the fact that no synaptic vesicle is present inside the dendrites of a neuron, chemical transmission is always from the axonal end to the dendritic terminal, and not the reverse.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F20-0526.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The chemical transmission that occurs at a synapse is unidirectional since the neurotransmitter is present in the axonal end of a neuron only."}

{"question": "The female menstrual cycle last roughly 28 days. Trace the The female menstrual cycle last roughly 28 days. Trace the ovarian and hormonal changes which occur during a normal menstrual cycle.", "solution": "Under the influence of primarily FSH from the pituitary, a single ovarian follicle containing an ovum reaches maturity in about two weeks. During the second week the follicle cells and other ovarian cell types are stimulated by FSH to increase their secretion of estrogen. Near the middle of the cycle, or about the fourteenth day, the heightened level of estrogen in the blood reaches a critical value which stimulates the hypothalamus to signal the pituitary to release a surge of LH. This surge of LH induces rupture of the ovarian follicle. This releases the mature ovum into the fallopian tube of the uterus, a process called ovulation. Estrogen secretion decreases for several days following ovulation, perhaps because of the negative feedback effect of excess estrogen on FSH, which stimulates its production. The ruptured follicle is rapidly transformed into the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone and, in lesser amounts, estrogen. The estrogen secreted by the corpus luteum raises its level in the blood, which inhibits further FSH secretion. Progesterone suppresses additional LH production, and thus prevents additional ovulation from occurring. The combined influence of progesterone and estrogen thickens and prepares the uterus for implantation of the embryo (in the event of fertilization). Failure of oocyte fer-tilization leads to the degeneration of the corpus luteum during the last few days of the cycle. The disintegrating corpus luteum is unable to maintain its secretion of estrogen and progesterone, and their blood concentrations drop rapidly. The marked decrease of estrogen and proges-terone lead to degeneration of the uterine wall followed by sloughing off of the uterine surface tissue. It also results in the removal of inhibition of FSH secretion.The blood concentration of FSH begins to rise, follicle and ovum development are stimulated, and the cycle begins anew. The cycle is usually broken up into three general phases. The first phase, encompassing follicle development up to ovulation, is called the follicular phase and lasts about 9 days FSH and estrogen dominate during the phase. The second phase, lasting from ovulation until the beginning of the disintegration of the uterine lining, is called the luteal phase and lasts approximately 14 days. Progesterone dominates during this phase. Following this phase is the flow phase which lasts 5 days, and is characterized by bleeding due to the sloughing off of the uterine lining.", "images": ["images/F21-0556_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F21-0556.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The menstrual cycle involves the maturation of an ovarian follicle and ovum under the influence of FSH, the release of the ovum during ovulation triggered by a surge of LH, and the transformation of the ruptured follicle into the corpus luteum which secretes progesterone and estrogen.

If the two lumps coalesce (a) what is the velocity of the combined lump after the collision, assuming that no external forces act on the system? (See figure.) (b) What is the energy lost due to collision?", "solution": "(a) Although all the velocities are in the same straight line, it is important to remember that momentum is really a vector and to distinguish care-fully between positive and negative directions. Choose the positive direction to be to the right, in the same direction as the initial velocity of the 30 gm lump of clay. Then, Initial momentum of 30 gm lump = (30 gm) (25 cm/sec) = 750 gm - cm/sec Initial momentum of 50 gm lump = (50 gm) (- 40 cm/sec) = - 2,000 gm-cm/sec Therefore, total initial momentum =750 gm-cm/sec - 2,000 gm-cm/sec = - 1250 gm-cm/sec. If V is the velocity of the combined 80 gm lump after the collision, Momentum after collision = (80 gm)V The law of conservation of linear momentum assures that the total momentum of the system before collision is equal to the system's momentum after collision. Equating the total momentum before to the total momentum after the collision, - 1250 gm-cm/sec = (80 gm)V V = -15.6 cm/sec.

One mole of Cl_2 will be formed from every 2 moles of NaCl reacted. Therefore, to find the quantity of Cl_2 formed one must first know the amount of NaCl reacted. This can be determined by solving for the weight of NaCl in the solution and dividing this number by the molecular weight to find the number of moles present. Since the solution is 20% NaCl, it means that 20% of its weight is made up by NaCl. weight of NaCl = 0.20 \u00d7 2.0 kg = 0.4 kg . Therefore, there are 0.4 kg or 400 g of NaCl present.

From the equation one sees that (1 /2) of this amount is equal to the number of moles of Cl_2 formed. no. of moles of Cl_2 = (1 / 2) \u00d7 6.84 moles = 3.42 moles. The weight of this number of moles of Cl_2 will be equal to the mole-cular weight of Cl_2 times the number of moles. (MW of Cl_2 = 71.0) weight of Cl_2= 3.42 moles \u00d7 (71.0g / mole) = 242.8g. From the reaction one can also see that if 2 moles of NaCl react, 2 moles of NaOH are formed. Here, 6.84 moles of NaCl is reacted, therefore, 6.84 moles of NaOH are formed. The weight of this quantity is equal to the number of moles \u00d7 the molecular weight. (MW of NaOH = 40). weight of NaOH = (40g / mole) \u00d7 6.84 moles = 273.6g.

{"question": "Calculate the magnitude of the gravitational red shift for a photon traveling from the sun to the earth.", "solution": "Because of Einstein's Mass-Energy Relation, any object having energy E has an equivalent mass m = E/c^2 where c is the speed of light. If the \"object\" is a photon, E = h\u0475 and the equivalent mass is m = h\u0475 /c^2(1) where h is Planck's constant. Now, we may ask, what happens if a photon is in a gravitational field? In traveling between 2 points in this field the potential energy of the photon changes. Hence, so must its total energy, E. We may write E' = E + (\\textphi' - \\textphi)(2) where \\textphi' - \\textphi is the change in potential energy of the photon, and E' is its new energy as a result of moving in the gravitational field. Rewriting(2) E' - E = \\textphi' - \\textphi or h\u0475' - h\u0475 = \\textphi' - \\textphi whence, h( \u0475' - \u0475) = \\textphi' - \\textphi Hence, we expect the photon to undergo a frequency shift of \u0475' - \u0475 = [(1/h)(\\textphi' - \\textphi)](3) as a result of a change in the potential energy of the photon. If the photon travels from the surface of the sun to the surface of the earth, the primed variables will refer to the surface of the earth. Similarly, the unprimed variables will refer to the sun's sur-face. In this case, the fractional change in frequency of the photon is (\u0475' - \u0475) / \u0475 =(\\textphi' - \\textphi) / h\u0475(4) Now, (see figure) \\textphi' = [(- GM_em') / R_e] - [(GM_sm') / D](5) and \\textphi' = [(- GM_sm) / R_s] - [(GM_sm) / D] whereG = 6.67 \u00d7 10^-11 [(N.m^2)/ kg^2] .

{"question": "What is an action potential? Discuss the physical and electrochemical changes during an action potential.", "solution": "We know that an unstimulated nerve cell exhibits a resting potential of about 60 millivolts across its membrane. An active pumping mechanism within the mem-brane causes the cell interior to accumulate a high concen tration of K^+ ions and the exterior a high concentration of Na^+ ions. Since the resting membrane is 50 to 75 times more permeable to K^+ than to Na^+, more K^+ moves by simple diffu-sion out of the cell than Na^+ moves into the cell in the resting state, and hence a potential difference exists across the membrane. Diffusion moves ions down their concen-tration gradients, which were established by the active transport pump. When a region of the axonal membrane is stimulated by a neurotransmitter, that region undergoes a set of electrochemical changes that constitutes an action potential. An action potential can be detected as a spike on a recording device, with a rising phase, a peak, and a falling phase, each corresponding to the characteristic flow of ions across the membrane of the axon. The duration of an action potential in a neuron is about 1 msec (.001 sec). During an action potential, the permeability of the membrane to Na^+ and K^+ ions is markedly altered. Initially, the membrane permeability to Na^+ undergoes a thousand--fold increase, whereas that to K^+ remains relatively un-changed. Consequently Na^+ ions rush into the cell. If one inserts an electrode into this region of the axon, one will find that the potential at the inside of the membrane starts to rise, as the influx of positive (Na^+) ions reduces the negativity of the cell interior. Soon, the inside of the membrane registers a net positive charge. The positivity rises until a peak is reached at about + 40 millivolts. This phase of the action poten-tial, when the membrane potential approaches or even rises above zero, is known as the depolarizing (rising) phase. At the peak of the action potential the increased sodium permeability is rapidly turned off, and immediately following this the permeability of the membrane to K+ suddenly increases (see Figure). Sodium entry stops and an efflux of K+ results due to the concentration gradient of K^+. The membrane potential starts to move toward zero, then drops below zero and finally restores the pre-exci-tation, or resting, state (at - 60 mV) . This phase of the action potential, when the membrane potential moves toward its resting level, is called the repolarizing (declining) phase. How depolarization is brought to a stop and repolarization is brought about is explained by a rapid shutting off of the increased sodium permeability (sodium inactivation).", "images": ["images/F20-0523_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F20-0523.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "An action potential is a set of electrochemical changes that occurs when a region of the axonal membrane is stimulated by a neurotransmitter.

A bacterial cell is fixed to a microscope slide, and the slide is covered with the following solutions in the order listed: crystal violet, iodine solution, alcohol , andsafranin. Bacteria stained by this method fall into two groups: gram-positive , which retain the crystal violet-iodine complex and are dyed a deep violet color, and gram-negative, which lose the crystal violet- iodine complex when treated with alcohol, and are stained by thesafranin, giving them a red color. The cell walls of bacteria are composed ofpeptidoglycan. This layer is thick in gram-positive cells, but thin in gram-negative cells, However, the latter havelipopolysaccharidelayer surrounding the thin peptidoglycan layer. The difference in staining is due to the high lipid content (about 20%) of the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria. (Lipids include fats, oils, steroids and certain other large organic molecules.) During the staining procedure of gram-negative cells, the alcohol treatment extracts the lipid from the cell wall, resulting in increased permeability of the wall. The crystal violet-iodine complex is thus leached from the cell in the alcohol wash . The decolorized cell then takes up the redsafranin. The cell walls of gram-positive bacteria have a lower lipid content, and thus become dehydrated during alcohol treatment. Dehydration causes decreased permeability of the wall, so that the crystal violet-iodine complex cannot leave the cell, and the cell is thus violet-colored.

{"question": "Write a Fortran program to calculate the odds of winning in a game of craps.", "solution": "Craps is played with a pair of dice. The rules are as follows: 1) If, on his first throw a player throws a 7 or 11 he wins the bet. 2) If, on his first throw, a player throws a 2, 3, or 12 he loses the bet. 3) If, on his first throw, a player throws any of the re-maining points he continues to throw: a) If he obtains the same score as on the first throw before throwing a 7, he wins. b) If he throws a 7 before obtaining the same score as on the first throw, he loses. The program is written using a function to generate ran-dom numbers arising out of a uniform distribution on ]0,1[. Once the random number generator has been created, an-other function subprogram uses it to obtain two random num-bers between zero and 1.

{"question": "How are tracers useful as a debugging aid?", "solution": "Suppose a computer runs and executes a program but produces incorrect results. If the programmer is unable to locate the bugs by the usual methods (running test data, checking size dimensions, etc.), an emergency technique called tracing can be applied. Tracing is usually done with an interpreter, whose routine dissects, analyzes and executes pseudo-instructions. (Pseudo-instructions do not form part of the program but are neces-sary for its execution). The tracer is an interpretive routine that analyzes and executes real machine instructions one at a time. To understand its opera-tion consider the following problem: The trouble with the program being debugged is suspected to be in the action of a loop. While the loop is being executed, the values of some variables go out of bounds. Using the tracer routine, the contents of the accumulator are printed out before each instruc-tion in the loop is executed. The point at which the variables misbehave can thus be located. The advantage of the trace routine is that the complete internal program is available for external inspection. This is, at the same time, its disadvantage. A series of nested loops may require a few thousand iterations. All these iterations will be executed and printed at printer speed. Clearly, the computer time involved is prohibitive. Hence, tracing functions have been modified to execute only non-branch commands, attached to high speed printers. If a branch is met, selected registers are printed before execution of the branch.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G25-0593.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "Tracers are useful as a debugging aid because they allow the programmer to inspect the complete internal program externally, helping to locate the point at which variables misbehave."}
{"question": "A 0.100 l container maintained at constant temperature contains 5.0 \u00d7 10^10 molecules of an ideal gas. How many molecules remain if the volume is changed to 0.005 l? What volume is occupied by 10,000 molecules at the initial temperature and pressure?", "solution": "Since only the volume changed and no molecules were added to or withdrawn from the system, the number of molecules at a volume of 0.005 l is the same as that at a volume of 0.100 l, or 5.0 x 10^10 molecules. In the second part of the problem we require a relationship between volume and number of molecules, taking into account the fact that the number of molecules can change. We will obtain such a relationship by modifying the ideal gas equation, PV = nRT, where P = pressure, V = volume, n = number of moles, R = gas constant, and T = absolute temperature. Since the number of moles is equal to the number of molecules, N, divided by Avogradro's number, A, or n = N/A, we can write the ideal gas equation as PV = nRT = N/A RT, or PVA = NRT. The initial and final pressure and temperature are the same. Also, A and r are constants. Denoting the initial volume and number of molecules by V_i and N_i , respectively, and the final volume and number of molecules by V_f and N_f , respectively, we obtain PV_i A = N_i RTandPV_f A = N_f RT. Dividing the second of these by the first we obtain [(PV_f A)/(PV_i A)] = [(N_f RT)/(N_i RT)]or(V_f /V_i ) = (N_f /N_i ), where we have cancelled all the constants.

{"question": "Profound changes in uterine morphology occur during the menstrual cycle and are completely attributable to the effects of estrogen and progesterone. Describe these changes.", "solution": "In the uterus estrogen stimulates growth of the smooth muscle layer called the myometrium, and the glandular epithelium called the endometrium, lining its inner surface. Progesterone acts on the endometrium and converts it to an actively secreting tissue. The glands become coiled and filled with glycogen; the blood vessels become more numerous; various enzymes accumulate in the glands and connective tissue of the lining. These changes are ideally suited to provide a favorable environment for implantation of a fertilized ovum. Progesterone also causes the mucus secreted by the cervix (a muscular ring of tissue at the mouth of the uterus which projects into the vagina) to become thick and sticky. This forms a \"plug\" which may constitute an important blockage against the entry of bacteria from the vagina. This is a protec-tive measure for the fetus should conception occur. As a result of the regression of the corpus luteum when no fertilization occurs, there is a fall in blood progesterone and estrogen levels. Consequently, the highly developed endometrial lining becomes deprived of its hormonal support. The most immediate result of this deprivation is the constriction of the uterine blood vessels, resulting in a decreased flow of oxygen and nutrients to the tissue. Subsequently, the lining disintegrates and gets sloughed off as the mentrual flow begins. This phase is called the menstrual phase and usually lasts for about 5 days. The flow ceases as the endometrium repairs itself, and then grows under the influence of the rising blood estrogen concentration. This phase is called the proli-ferative phase, and lasts for 9 days. This phase covers the time from menstruation up until ovulation. After ovulation and formation of the corpus luteum, progesterone acts synergistically with estrogen to induce formation of the glandular endometrium. This period, called the secretory phase (lasting about 14 days) is terminated by disintegration of the corpus luteum. Thus the cycle is completed and a new one begins. The phases of the menstrual cycle can be named either in terms of the ovarian or uterine events. The cycle is di-vided into follicular and luteal phases with respect to the ovary; proliferative and secretory phases are the terms re-ferring to the uterine state. It is important to realize that the uterine changes simply reflect the effects of vary-ing blood concentrations of estrogen and progesterone throughout the cycle.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F21-0559.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Estrogen stimulates growth of the myometrium and endometrium in the uterus.

{"question": "Suppose a fisherman was interested in trying to extract the maximum number of fish from a pond or lake. Why would it not be to his economic advantage to reduce the fish populations by excessive harvesting?", "solution": "The ideal economic strategy for the fisher- man to follow would be to catch only enough fish so as to keep the population at a level of optimal yield. If the population is allowed to reach the maximum that the environment can support, or if it is exploited to the point where the organisms become scarce, the yield will decline. This phenomenon exists because the greatest amount of increase in population size does not occur either when the population is very low or when the population has reached the carrying capacity of the environment. The point of greatest growth and hence the maximum replacement capacity of a population occurs at a point midway on the exponential part of an S-shaped growth curve, that is, half way between the baseline and the maximum carrying capacity (see figure). This point corresponds to the point of steepest rise on the S- shaped curve. At this point, the greatest number of new individuals are added to the population in a given amount of time. This maximum rate of population growth is referred to as the optimal yield. Fish populations, as well as other animal populations that man harvests, can be obtained with much less effort at a point of optimal yield than populations reduced by overfishing. Moreover, the greater the exploitation of populations, the more the population will come to consist of younger and smaller individuals, which are usually the least valuable commercially. The proportion of large fish caught is higher when the population is at a point of optimal yield. Consequently, as the fish populations are reduced, more expensive and sophisticated ships and trawling techniques are required to produce the same amount of yield.", "images": ["images/F30-0771_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F30-0771.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "Optimal yield"}

One of the problems was to find out how many nucleotides are needed to code for one amino acid. We know that there are four different types of nucleotides because there are four different nitrogenous bases. We also know that there are 20 kinds of amino acids. Four nucleotides taken two at a time provide only 16 different combinations (4^2 = 16), which are insufficient to code for the 20 different amino acids. Four nucleotides taken three at a time provide 64 different combinations (4^3 = 64). At first glance, this would seem to provide many more terms than are needed, since there are only 20 different amino acids. It was believed at one time that the excess combinations were not used to specify any amino acids. However, there is now strong evidence that all but three of the 64 combinations do, in fact, code for amino acids, and that as many as six different nucleotide triplets may specify the same amino acid. The term degeneracy is used to describe the fact that a given amino acid may be specified by more than onecodon. The fundamental characteristics of the genetic code are now well established: it is a triplet code, with three adjacent nucleotides, termed acodon, specifying each amino acid. A second problem with the genetic code is whether there is overlapping or not. For example, is the sequence CAGAUAGAC read only as CAG, AUA, GAC or can it also be read CAG, AGA, GAU, AUA, UAG, AGA, GAC? Is each nucleotide part of onecodonor three? The amino acid sequences of several mutant forms of the hemoglobin molecule have been analyzed. In each, only a single amino acid in the molecule is sub-stituted. In contrast, if the code were overlapping and a given nucleotide were part of three adjacentcodons, we would expect three adjacent amino acids to be changed. For example, a single substitution (circled) in the sequence CAG A UA GAC, resulting in CAGCUAGAC, would affect only the amino acid specified by AUA if no overlapping occurred. If there were overlapping, such a change would affect 3 amino acids, namely those coded for by AGA, GAU, and AUA. Experi-ments with syntheticpolynucleotideshaving known base sequences have shown conclusively that the code is not over-lapping. One can synthesize a messenger RNA strand con-taining onlyuracil, UUUUU... (polyuridylic acid). For every 3 bases added to the mRNA, only one additional phenylalanine will be incorporated into its peptide chain (the UUUcodon codes for phenylalanine). Finally, the code iscommaless, i.e., no punctuation is necessary, since the code is read beginning at a fixed point, three nucleotides at a time, until the reading mechanism comes to a specific 'termination'codon, which signals the end of the message. The fact that there is punctuation betweencodonsbecomes important in deletion or insertion mutations. Adding or subtracting a nucleotide within a sequence ofcodonsthrows the entire reading frame and can change out of line everycodonpast the point of insertion or deletion. For example, the gene sequence AGAUCUUGG would normally be read as AGA, UCU, UGG and would code for the amino acidsarginine, serine, and tryptophan. The insertion of an extra nucleotide (circled), would result in the sequence AGAU G CUUGG, which would read AGA, UGC, UUG and code forarginine,cysteine, andleucine. The deletion of a nucleotide would have a similar effect. If C were eliminated, the code would read AGA, UUU, and would code forarginine and phenylalanine.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F24-0616.htm", "image_question": true, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The genetic code is a triplet code, with three adjacent nucleotides, termed a codon, specifying each amino acid.

{"question": "A manufacturer can produce X units of an item at a cost given by the following equation: Cost = C = 15 + 0.001X^2 The relationship between the number of units and price is given by P = 35 - . 1X (the producer is a monopolist). How many units should the monopolist produce in order to maximize his total return?", "solution": "The maximization problem may be written as follows: Max {X.(P-C)} X where P = 35 - O.1X C = 15 + 0.001X^2 , X \\geq 0 When X, the quantity produced is zero, there is zero pro-fit. Similarly, when the price of X equals the cost of X, profits are zero. This occurs when P = C or, 35 - 0.1X = 15 + 0.001X^2 Solving for X gives X = 100. Thus profits are zero when X = 0 and X = 100. Assuming profit is a continuous function of output Rolle's theorem may be applied to conclude that the maximum profit point lies in the interval (0,100). Numerical approximation of this maximum is performed on the computer using the GOLDEN SECTION method. To illustrate the method, suppose the graph of profit versus production looks as follows: In the interval [0,100] there is only one maximum. Suppose we pick two points, X_1 and X_2 in that interval and find their ordinates on the curve. If f(X2) > f(X1), then the interval of search may be reduced from [0,100] to [X_1,100] and the interval [0,X_1] can be eliminated. The original interval [X_L X_u] is equal to 1 (Fig. 2). Let \\tau equal the ratio of the long subinterval to the total interval, i.e. (X_2 - X_L) /( X_u - X_L) = \\tau Since and X1 and X2 have been located symmetrically about the center of the interval, the distance between X_1 and X_u is also \\tau. From Fig. 2, the interval [X_L X1] will be elimi-nated after the first iteration since f(X_2) > f(X_1). In order for X2 to be properly located within the interval [X_1,X_u] for the next iteration, the following must be true: (X_u - X_2) / (X_u - X_1) = \\tau But, from Fig. 2, X_u - X_2 = 1 - \\tau and X_u - X_1 = \\tau. Thus, [(1 - \\tau) / \\tau] = \\tau,or \\tau^2 + \\tau - 1 = 0.(1) Solving (1) for \\tau we obtain \\tau = [(\\surd5 - 1) / 2] = 0.618. Thus, according to the GOLDEN SECTION rule, X_2 should be 0.618 from X_L and X_1, should be 0.618 from X_u . For the given problem, the selection of points in the search interval would proceed as follows: X_1 = 100 - 0.618 \u00d7 100 = 100 - 61.8 = 38.2; X_2 = 0.618 \u00d7 100 = 61.8. From Fig. 1, f(X_2) > f(X_1) so the interval [0,38.2] is eliminated. The next point is located at 0.618 \u00d7 (length of interval) = 0.618 \u00d7 (61.8) = 38.2 from the left end of the interval, or X_3 = 38.2 + 38.2 = 76.4. Since f(X_2) > f(X_3), [76.4,100] is eliminated. X_4 is located at 0.618 \u00d7 (length of interval) = 0.618 \u00d7 (38.2) = 23.6 from the right end or 76.4 - 23.6 = 52.8. After three iterations the interval within which the optimum is located has been reduced from [0,100] to [52.8]. These values are now assigned to X_L and X_u. The process is continued until the length of the interval is less than some preassigned \\epsilon > 0. The average of f(X) at final X_L and X u is then the required approximation to the optimum. The most efficient method of locating the points is the GOLDEN SECTION technique.", "images": ["images/G18-0455_files/image002.jpg", "images/G18-0455_files/image004.jpg", "images/G18-0455_files/image006.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G18-0455.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "X = 100"}

In the previous section one found that each cubic foot contains 4.032 \u00d7 10^-3 lb of Br^-, thus one finds the amount of Br^- in 31.75 cu. ft. by multiplying the number of cubic feet by the weight of one cubic foot. weight of Br^- in 1 ton sea water = = 31.75 cu. ft. \u00d7 4.032 \u00d7 10^-3 lb/cu. ft. = .128 lb. One finds the number of moles present by dividing .128 lb by the molecular weight in pounds. (MW of Br^- = 80gr/mole.) There are 454 g in 1 lb, therefore grams are con-verted to pounds by multiplying the number of grams by 1 lb / 454 \\alpha. MW of Br^- in lb = 80 g/mole \u00d7 (1 lb / 454g) = .1762 lb/mole One can now find the number of moles of Br^- present in one ton. no. of moles = (weight of Br^-) / (MW in lbs) no. of moles = (.128 lbs) / (.1762 lbs /mole) = .73 moles . From the equation one knows that 1/2 as many moles of Cl_2 are needed as Br^-. Therefore, the amount of Cl_2 used is equal to 1/2 of .73 moles or .365 moles. The volume of one mole of gas at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure, 0\\textdegreeC and 1atm) is defined to be 22.4 liters. Therefore, one can find the volume of Cl_2 gas required for the reaction by multiplying the number of moles of gas present by 22.4 liters. volume of Cl_2 = .365 \u00d7 22.4 liters = 8.18 liters.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E04-0160.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "248.02 cubic feet, 8.18 liters"}

{"question": "What is meant by a hydrostatic skeleton? In which organisms is such a structure found?", "solution": "Cnidarians (coelenterata) such as hydra, flatworms such as planaria , and annelids like the earth worms all move by the same basic principle of antagonistic muscles. They have no hardexo- or endo - skeleton to anchor the ends of their muscles. Instead the noncompressible fluid contents of the body cavity serve as a hydrostatic skeleton. Such animals typically have a set of circular muscles, the contraction of which decreases the diameter and increases the length of the animal, and a set of antagonistic longitudinal muscles, which, when contracted, decrease the length and increase the diameter of the animal. As an example, the leech is often used. The leech attaches its posterior end to the substrate by means of a sucker, extends its body forward by contraction of the circular muscles, attaches its front end by a sucker, and then detaches the posterior end and draws it forward by contraction of the longitudinal muscles. Note that circular and longitudinal muscle are found in man: the smooth muscle lining his hollow visceral organs, for example. By alternate contractions of each muscle layer, peristaltic waves propel the contents along the hollow organ. For instance, this occurs in the esopha-gus, intestines, oviducts,ureters, etc. The relatively soft internal tissues of solid-bodied animals like the leech can function as a hydrostatic skeleton only to some extent. More active wormlike animals, like the annelids, have evolved segmented bodies in which fluid is contained in a partitioned series of cavities. In addition to segmentation of the body cavity, there is a segmentation of the musculature; the fact that each segment of the body has its circular and longi-tudinal muscles makes possible effective use of the compartmented hydrostatic skeleton. The arrangement of the hyd-rostatic skeleton allows for peristaltic movements down the length of the organism. This aids the organism in burrowing. Some marine worms have additional diagonally arranged muscles that permit more complex movements- of the body and thepaddlelike parapodia that extend laterally from the body wall. Many marine worms live in tubes and the movements of theparapodiaare important not only in locomotion, but in moving currents of water laden with oxygen and nutrients through these tubes.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F19-0487.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The noncompressible fluid contents of the body cavity serve as a hydrostatic skeleton in organisms like Cnidarians, flatworms, and annelids."}

{"question": "Describe the development of a mammalian egg from cleavage up to the development of the fetal membranes.", "solution": "Cleavage in a mammalian egg takes place as the egg moves slowly down the oviduct, driven along by cilia and muscular contraction of the wall of the duct. The journey takes about four days in the case of cells, the morula, which divides and rearranges into a hollow ball of cells, the blastocyst. The blastocyst subdi-vides into an inner cell mass from which the embryo devel-ops, and an enveloping layer of cells, the trophoblast. The cavity of the blastocyst may be compared to the blastocoel, but the embryo is not a blastula, for its cells are diffe-rentiated into two types. The cells ot the inner cell mass differentiate further into a thin layer of flat cells, the hypoblast, which is located on the interior surface of the mass adjacent to the blastocoel, and which represents the endoderm. The remaining cells of the inner cell mass become the epiblast. The cells of the hypoblast, spreading along the inner surface of the trophoblast, eventually surround the cavity of the blastocyst, forming a \"yolk sac,\" which is filled with fluid, not yolk. As the hypoblast spreads out, the inner cell mass also spreads and becomes a disc shaped plate of cells similar to the blastodisc of bird and reptilian eggs. The blastodisc becomes delimitated from the rest of the embryo. Gastrulation begins with the formation of a primitive streak and Hensen's node in which cells migrate downward, laterally and anteriorly between the epiblast and hypoblast. Those cells which remain between these two layers comprise the mesoderm. Those cells which join the hypoblast become endoderm. A crevice appears between the cells of the inner cell mass, which then enlarges to become the amniotic cavity. The cavity of the blastocyst becomes filled with mesodermal cells, and is comparable to the subgerminal cavity in the bird. The embryonic disc comes to lie as a plate between the two cavities, connected to the trophoblast at the posterior end by a group of extraembryonic mesoderm cells, the body stalk or allantoic stalk. The non- functional endodermal part of the allantois, which develops as a tube from the yolk sac, is rudimentary and never reaches the trophoblast. Thus, after two weeks of development the human embryo is a flat, two-layered disc of cells about 250 microns across, connected by a stalk to the trophoblast.", "images": ["images/F23-0595_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F23-0595.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Cleavage in a mammalian egg takes place as the egg moves slowly down the oviduct, driven along by cilia and muscular contraction of the wall of the duct.

{"question": "Differentiate between adaptive radiation and convergent evolution . Diagram illustrating the difference between divergent and convergent evolution. In adaptive radiation, a single stock may branch to give many diverging stocks (in the given diagram,1 stockdiverges \\rightarrow 2 stocks). In convergent evolution, many stocks that are originally quite different can come to resemble each other more and more; as time passes, they converge. In the given diagram, 2 stocks are shown converging.", "solution": "Because of the constant competition for food and living space, a group of organisms will tend to spread out and occupy as many different habitats as pos-sible. This process, by which a single ancestral species evolves to a variety of forms that occupy somewhat different habitats, is termed adaptive radiation. Adaptive radiation is clearly an advantageous process in evolution in that it enables the organisms to tap new sources of food or to escape from predators. A classical illustration of adaptive radiation is the great variety of finches found on the Galapagos Islands west of Ecuador. These finches, derived from a single common ancestor, exhibit diversity in beak size and structures, as well as in feeding habits, all of which are mutually related. Some of these birds feed on seeds, others feed mainly on cacti, and still others live in trees and eat insects. The diversity of food sources on the island has allowed each of the many forms of finches to survive in its particular habitat, and thus, prevent intra specific competition for food and space. Such adaptive radiation is often called divergent evolution, since its result is a diversity of adaptive forms evolving from a common ancestor. An opposite process is convergent evolution, which also occurs quite frequently. Convergent evolution is the process by which two or more unrelated groups become adapted to a similar environment, and in doing so, develop characteristics that are more or less similar. For example, wings have evolved hot only in birds but also in mammals (bats), reptiles (pterosaurs), and insects (grasshoppers). Likewise, the shark (a cartilaginous fish), the dolphin, and the porpoise (both mammals) have developed marked superficial similarity because of their adaptation to a similar environment.", "images": ["images/F27-0708_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F27-0708.htm", "image_question": true, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Adaptive radiation is the process by which a single ancestral species evolves to a variety of forms that occupy somewhat different habitats.

{"question": "What are the evolutionary advances shown in the anatomy of the proboscis worms? How do these animals compare with the round worms?", "solution": "The proboscis worms (or nemerteans) are a relatively small group of animals. Almost all are marine forms, excepting a few which inhabit fresh water or damp soil. They have long, narrow bodies, either cylin-drical or flattened, and range in length from 5 cm. to 20 meters. Their most remarkable organ is the proboscis, a long, hollow, muscular tube which they evert from the anterior end of the body to capture food. A mucus secreted by the proboscis helps the worm in catching and retaining the prey. There are three important evolutionary advances achieved by the proboscis worms. First, these animals have a complete digestive tract, with a mouth at one end for ingesting food, an anus at the other for egesting feces, and an esophagus and intestine in between. This is in contrast to the coelenterates and planarians, in which food enters and wastes leave by the same opening. As in the flatworms, water and metabolic wastes are eli-minated from the proboscis' body by flame cells. The second advance exhibited by the proboscis worms is the separation of digestive and circulatory functions. These organisms have a primitive circulatory system consisting of only three muscular blood vessels which extend the length of the body and are connected by transverse vessels. Hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein present in higher animals, is found in the red blood cells of this rudimen-tary circulatory system. In the absence of a heart, the blood is circulated through the vessels by the movements of the body and the contractions of the muscular blood vessels. Capillaries have not developed in these animals. The third advance in the anatomy of the proboscis worms is seen in the structure of the nervous system. There is a primitive \"brain\" at the anterior end of the body, consisting of two groups of nerve cells, called ganglia, connected by a ring of nerves. Two nerve cords run poste-riorly from the brain. Compared to the proboscis worms, the round worms (or nematodes) are a far more numerous and ecologically diver-sified group than the proboscis worms. There are about 8000 species of round worms, all with a similar basic body plan. They have elongate, cylindrical, threadlike bodies which are pointed at both ends. Their many habitats include the sea, fresh water, the soil, and other animals or plants which they parasitize. This last characteristic is in sharp contrast to the proboscis worms, none of which is parasitic and none is of economic importance. Common parasitic nematodes are the hookworm, trichina worm, ascaris worm, filaria worm and guinea worm, which all utilize man as the host. Because of their parasitic exis-tence, these worms are covered with a protective cuticle and have only longitudinal muscles for simple bending movements. Contrary to the proboscis worms, which have cilia all over the epithelium and the lining of the diges-tive tract, none of the nematodes has any cilia at all. However, like the proboscis worms, the round worms have evolved a complete digestive system, a separate circulatory system, and a nervous system composed of a \"brain\" and nerve cords.", "images": ["images/F11-0288_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F11-0288.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The evolutionary advances shown in the anatomy of the proboscis worms are a complete digestive tract, the separation of digestive and circulatory functions, and a primitive nervous system.

{"question": "How isaldosteronerelated to proper kidney functioning? How is its secretion controlled?", "solution": "Aldosteroneis a hormone produced by the adrenal cortex. It is thought that this hormone stimulates sodiumreabsorptionin the distal convolu-ted tubules of the kidney by altering the permeability of the tubules to sodium. In the complete absence of this hormone, a patient may excrete close to 30gmsof sodium per day, whereas excretion may be virtually zero whenaldosteroneis present in large quantities. The major clue that some substance secreted by the adrenal cortex controls sodium reabsorptioncame from the observation of patients who had missing or diseased adrenal glands. These patients were seen to excrete large quantities of sodium in the urine, despite a decreasedglomerularfiltration rate (which would tend to reduce sodium loss). This indicated that decreased tubularreabsorptionmust be responsible for the sodium loss. Aldosteronesecretion is controlled by reflexes involving the kidneys themselves. Lining the arterioles in the kidney are specialized cells which synthesize and secrete an enzyme known asrenin(not to be confused with rennin, a digestive enzyme secreted by the stomach) into the blood. Renincatalyzes a reaction in whichangiotensinI, a small polypeptide, is split; off from a large plasma protein calledangiotensinogen. Angiotensinogenis synthesized by the liver and is always present in the blood. It is still not certain howreninsecretion is controlled by the kidney. There seems to be multiple nerve inputs to therenin-secreting cells, and their respective roles have not yet been determined. AngiotensinI is converted toAngiotensinII via a dif-ferent enzyme. AngiotensinII then acts to stimulatealdos-teronesecretion by the adrenal gland, and as such consti-tutes the primary input to the adrenal controlling the pro-duction and release of the hormone.Aldosteronethen acts on the kidney tubules to stimulate sodiumreabsorption.AngiotensinII has other effects on the body including stimulat-ing thirst centers to ultimately increase blood volume by drinking, and causing vasoconstriction which increases blood pressure.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F18-0452.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Aldosterone stimulates sodium reabsorption in the kidney tubules and its secretion is controlled by reflexes involving the kidneys themselves."}
{"question": "What is an organizer and how does it influence develop-ment ?", "solution": "An organizer is a chemical secreted by certain cells in the embryo, which diffuses into and influences surrounding cells. The presence of organizers is the whole basis for the concept of embryonic induction. In the frog and salamander, it was found that the dorsal lip of the blastopore was very important in organizing the development of the body parts . When a portion of this dorsal lip was transplanted to the ventral region of another embryo, it acted as an organizer. The cells surrounding it formed into a separate head, and part of the body. The result was a Siamese type of twin salamander. This demonstrated that the cells in one part of the body of the embryo had the power to form body parts characteristic of other regions, but they needed the stimulation of the organizer from the dorsal lip in order to function. Hans Spemann did pioneering work on organizers. The optic vesicle in the embryo, he noted, stimulates the adjacent ectoderm to form the lens of the eye. When the optic vesicle is removed from the head and inserted at any point under the skin of the embryo's body, it will organize the overlying ectoderm into a lens . This principle of embryonic induction also takes place in many other areas of the embryo and plays a role in the development of such tissues as the nervous system and the limbs.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F23-0598.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "An organizer is a chemical secreted by certain cells in the embryo, which diffuses into and influences surrounding cells."}
{"question": "What is differential reproduction? What factors bring about differential reproduction?", "solution": "When the percentage of viable offspring carrying a certain genotype cannot be accounted for by purely random mating, differential reproduction is said to have occurred. Differential reproduction can result from nonrandom mating, differential fecundity, or dif-ferences in either zygote viability or offspring fertility. Nonrandom mating may occur due to genotypic variaton, genetic mutations, or both. There are well established behavior patterns of courtship and mating in many species, which are primarily genetically controlled. For example, in many species of birds and fish, a brightly colored spot on the male serves to stimulate the female for copu-lation. Males having this characteristic will succeed in finding a mate easily and more frequently than males with-out this trait, hence producing in their lifetime more offspring carrying their genes. Males lacking this trait will find it difficult to pass their genes on to succeeding generations. Mutations that lead to, formation of bigger or brighter spots will benefit the males with the mutated gene by rendering them more attractive to females. Conversely, mutations that lead to disappearance of these spots or formation of smaller, duller ones, will have a negative selective value. These mutations are inherited by the progeny, perpetuating differential reproduction through nonrandom mating. Success in mating, however, can neither guarantee successful fertilization nor assure large numbers of off-spring. Such factors can also be important in differen-tial reproduction. Differences in the number of gametes produced by different individuals and the proportion of their gametes that will successfully unite with others to form zygotes can be collectively termed differential fecundity. Differential fecundity may be determined ge-netically. Within a species, the individuals producing large numbers of gametes or having a large percentage of successful matings (resulting in fertilization) will nec-essarily contribute the greatest percentage of genes to the next generation. This depends, of course, on the via-bility of the zygotes formed. In environments which result in low zygote viability, individuals having high fecundity will tend to reproduce in larger numbers. In fish, for example, zygotes must be fertilized and also develop in an external environment; those species producing large numbers of both gametes and zygotes will tend to be preserved. Mammals, on the other hand, whose zygotes develop internally, cannot and need not produce such large numbers of gametes or zygotes. In fact, large numbers of zygotes may actually be a disadvantage, since this limits the amount of care and feeding available to each offspring. Another factor affecting the reproducing ability of a given individual or individuals is the fertility of the offspring. The offspring produced as a result of a given mating may be viable, but unless they are themselves fertile, the result is the same as if they were not viable. Thus, it is the interaction of a variety of factors which is responsible for the reproductive capacity of a given individual or species. Any one of these factors could be responsible for differential reproduction.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F27-0715.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Differential reproduction is when the percentage of viable offspring carrying a certain genotype cannot be accounted for by purely random mating.

What is the length at 17\\textdegreeC if the saturation pressures of water vapor at 7\\textdegreeC and 17\\textdegreeC are 0.75 cm and 1.42 cm of mercury, respectively?", "solution": "Since the tube is horizontal and the pressure at the open end of the water column is always atmospheric, the pressure at the closed end of the water column is also always atmospheric. The pressure in the moist air is made up of the partial pressures of air and of water vapor. When the equilibrium between the liquid and gas phases of a liquid is reached in a closed volume, the pressure of the vapor acting on the liquid equals the saturated vapor pressure. The eva-poration process effectively stops once this pressure is attained by the vapor.

Coulomb's law for the force between two charged particles is F = (kq_1 q_2/d^2) and this force is exerted over arbitrarily large values of d. Consider 2 charges separated by a distance equal to the diameter of the Milky Way galaxy (1 \u00d7 10^21 m). According to the exchange picture, the electric force between the charged particles is achieved by the exchange of virtual (unobservable) photons between two electrically charged particles. Any measurements made to detect the virtual photon's presence would require measurement precisions ex-ceeding those permitted by the uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in the position of these photons is then the distance over which they are exchanged, ( in this instance 1 \u00d7 10^21 m ) for we know that the photons must be somewhere between the 2 charges. Thus m = [h/{4\\pi(\\Deltax)c}] = [(6.6 \u00d7 10^-34 J s)/{(4) (3.14) (1 \u00d7 10^21 m)(3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s)}] = 1.8 \u00d7 10^-64 kg.

{"question": "Explain how a change of one base on the DNA can result in sickle-cellhemoglobin rather than normal hemoglobin.", "solution": "If one base within a portion of DNA comprising a gene is altered, andthat gene is transcribed, the codon for one amino acid on the mRNA willbe dif-ferent. The polypeptide chain which is translated from that mRNA maythen have a different amino acid at this position. Although there are hundredsof amino acids in a protein, a change of only one can have far-reaching effects. The human hemoglobin molecule is composed of two halves of protein, each half formed by two kinds of polypeptide chains, namely an alphachain and a beta chain. In persons suffering from sickle-cell anemia,.amutation has occurred in the gene which forms the beta chain. As a result, a single amino acid substitution occurs, whereglutamicacid is replacedbyvaline. Onecodonforglutamicacid is AUG, while one for valineis UUG. (A = adenine, U = uracil, G = guanine). If U is substituted forA in thecodonforglutamicacid, thecodonwill specifyvaline. Thus, it iseasy to see how a change in a single base has resulted in this amino acidsubstitu-tion. This change is so important, however, that the entire hemoglobinmolecule behaves differently. When the oxygen level in the blooddrops, the altered molecules tend to form end to end associations andthe entire red blood cell is forced out of shape, forming a sickle- shaped body. These may aggregate to block the capillaries. More importantly, thesesickledcells cannot carry oxygen properly and a person havingthem suffers from severe hemolytic anemia, which usually leads to deathearly in life. The condition is known as sickle-cell anemia. In a normal hemoglobin molecule, theglutamicacid residue in question , being charged, is located on the outside of the hemoglobin moleculewhere it is in contact with the aqueous medium. When this residueis replaced byvaline, a non-polar residue, the solubility of the hemoglobinmolecule decreases. In fact, the hydrophobic side chain of valinetends to form weak vanderWaals bonds with other hydrophobic sidechains leading to the aggregation of hemoglobin molecules.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F24-0636.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "A mutation in the gene which forms the beta chain of the hemoglobin molecule results in a single amino acid substitution, where glutamic acid is replaced by valine.

{"question": "The solubility product constant of magnesium hydroxide is 8.9 \u00d7 10-^12 , calculate its solubility in (a) water and (b) .05M NaOH.", "solution": "Whenever an ionic solid is placed in water, an equilibrium is established between its ions and the excess solid phase.

The concentration of solid is always constant, no matter how much is in contact with the ions. This means the solid phase will not appear in the equilibrium constant expression.

The only way a function of x can equal a function of t is if both functions equal the same constant K. Hence, we separate (3) into (-h^2/2m) [1/{\\psi (x)}] [{d^2 \\psi (x)}/dx^2}] + V = K(4) ih[1/{\\textphi (t)}] [{d \\textphi (t)}/dt] = K(5) Remember that this is true only if V is time in-dependent. We first solve the differential equation in (5).

Taking the exponential of both sides \\textphi (t) = e ^[(Kt/ih) + C]= e^c e^k ^t/ih(6) But e^c is a new constant. Letting e^c = A we may write (6) as \\textphi (t) = A c^ Kt/ih= A e - ^i ^k ^t/h(7) Equation (7) may be written in terms of sines and cosines since e^-ix = cos x - i sin x Hence, \\textphi (t) = A [cos Kt/h- i sin Kt/h] and \\textphi (t) is an oscillatory function of time with fre-quency \\omega_0 = K/h. The energy of particle is E = hv and\\omega = (2\\piE/h) = (E/h) But the only physical interpretation \\omega_0 can have is that it is the particle's frequency.

A particle moving between impenetrable walls is a picturesque way of describing a particle in an infinite potential well. (See figure.) We may describe this V by \\infty, x \\leq 0 V =0, 0 \\leq x \\leq L \\infty, x \\geq L Hence, within the well, V = 0 and (10) becomes [{d^2 \\psi (x)}/dx^2] + (2mE/h^2) \\psi (x) = 0 This is the equation of simple harmonic motion, and has the general solution \\psi (x) = B cos [\\surd(2mE)/h] x + C sin [\\surd(2mE)/h] x(11) In order to \"taper\" (11) to the problem at hand, note that \\psi (0) = 0 \\psi (L) = 0(12) since, if the potential is infinite at these points, we cannot expect to find the particle there.

{"question": "What is a fruit? What roles do fruits play in the dispersion of the seeds?", "solution": "The ovary of an angiosperm is the basal part of the pistil. The ovary contains the ovules which will become the seeds after fertilization. Concomitant with the development of the zygote into an embryo, the ovary enlarges to form the fruit. A fruit therefore can be defined as a matured ovary, containing the matured ovules. A true fruit is one developed solely from the ovary. An accessory fruit is one developed from sepals, petals, or the receptacle as well as the ovary. The apple, for example, is mostly an enlarged receptacle; only the core is derived from the ovary. All angiosperms have fruits, either true or accessory. This characteristic makes them unique among living things. Fruits represent an adaptation for the dispersal of the seeds by various means, and they may be classified according to this criterion as wind-borne fruits, water-borne fruits, or animal-borne fruits. Wind-borne fruits are light and dry so that they can easily be carried by wind. In the tumbleweeds, the whole plant, or fruiting structure, is blown by the wind and scatters seeds as it goes. Other wind-borne fruits, such as the maple, have evolved wing - like structures. Still others, such as the dandelion, develop aplumelike pappuswhich keeps the light fruits aloft. Water-borne fruits are adapted for floating, either because air is trapped in some part of the fruit, or because the fruit contains corky tissue. The coconut fruit has an outer coat especially adapted for carriage by ocean currents. Rain is another means of fruit dispersal by water, and is particularly important for plants living on hillsides or mountain slopes. Animal-borne fruits are mostly fleshy. This makes them appetizing to vertebrates. When fleshy fruits ripen, they undergo a series of characteristic changes, mediated by the hormone ethylene. Among these are a rise in sugar content, a general softening of the fruit through the breakdown ofpecticsubstances, and often a change in color to conspicuous bright red, yellow, blue, or black. When such fruits are eaten by birds or animals, they spread the seeds that lie within-them either passing them unharmed through their digestive tracts or carrying them as adherent passengers on their fur or feathers. Some fruits are further equipped with prickles, hooks, hairs, or sticky coverings, and so can be transported for long distances by animals. The modifications of seeds for dispersal by animals illustrate an evolutionary adaptation to the coexistence of plant and animal forms.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F08-0200.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "A fruit can be defined as a matured ovary, containing the matured ovules.

{"question": "Fats are not digested in the stomach even though there exists a lipase in the gastric fluid. Explain why.", "solution": "The general formula of a fat or lipid may be written (RCO_2)_3C_3H_5, where the R's can be the same or different. It may be defined as an ester of glycerol and three long-chaincarboyxlicacids. These ester linkages may be hydrolyzed (degraded) by digestive enzymes called lipases. Such enzymes can function only under certain specific conditions. This is the reason why the lipase in gastric juice cannot digest lipids in the stomach. This lipase has an optimum pH of 7, a neutral solution. In the stomach, however, due to the presence ofHClfor other digestive purposes, there is an acidic environment. Thus, the lipase is virtually inactive under these conditions. As such, the fat will not be digested. But note, even if the lipase were active, lipid would still be undigested. To understand why, consider the following: Fats are insoluble in water, and, as such, tend to form globules in the body. Digestive enzymes cannot penetrate such globules. Only those fat molecules at the surface can be acted upon. The surface area can be increased, however, by breaking the globule into smaller droplets - a process called emulsification.

To calculate E, the potential at other than standard conditions (25\\textdegreec and 1 molar concentrations are the standard conditions), you can employ the Nernst equation. It is stated E = E\\textdegree -(.0592 / n) log K, where E\\textdegree = standard electrode potential, n = number of electrons gained or lost as shown in the overall reaction and K is the ratio of con-centration of ions on right side of equation to those on left side.

{"question": "Parasitic organisms often have complex life cycles invol-ving two or more host species.

Describe the life cycle of this nematode.", "solution": "Adultfilariaworms of the genus-speciesWucheriabancrofti, inhabit the lymph glands of man, par-ticularly in the upper leg or hip. Large numbers of these nematodes block the lymph glands and prevent the return of fluid to the blood stream. This causes enormous swel-ling of the legs, a condition known as elephantiasis. Blocking of the lymph glands also predisposes the host to microbial infections. Thesefilaraworms mature in the host's lymph glands where they later lay their eggs. The larval nematodes then migrate to the peripheral blood stream. The migration to the peripheral circulation has been found to correlate temporally with the activity ofmosquitos. When a mosquito of a certain species bites the infected person, the larvalfilariaerespond by entering the host's peripheral blood-stream. When othermosquitos subsequently bite the host and suck his blood, some larvae move into the bodies of these intermediate hosts.

{"question": "Discuss the responses of stomata to environmental factors.", "solution": "A number of environmental factors affectstomatalopening and closing. Water loss is the most important among them. When theturgorof a leaf drops below a certain critical point because of rapid evapo-ration to the atmosphere, thestomatalaperture responds to this loss by becoming smaller or closed. In this situation, the need for water conservation overrides the need for the intake of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. With the stomata closed, the leaf cells can use the carbon dioxide produced by their respiration, and thus be able to sustain a very low level of photosynthesis. Factors other than water loss that affect the stomata include light, carbon dioxide concentration, and temperature. It has been shown that when a turgid leaf which has been kept in darkness for a few hours is exposed to light, the stomata open. When the light is switched off, the stomata close. Light apparently plays a role in the opening and closing of the stomata. Light is now believed to initiate a series of enzymatic reactions which break down insoluble starch to many smaller, soluble glucose molecules in the guard cells of a stoma. As the solute concentration increases, water enters the guard cells by osmosis, increasing theirturgor, thereby opening the stomata. The role of carbon dioxide is similar to that of light, in the opening and closing of the stomata. It is found experimentally that a decrease in carbon dioxide increases the pH in a cell and an increase in pH facilitates the conversion of starch to glucose. This is explained by the fact that the enzymephosphorylaseis stimulated by the increased pH to convert starch to glucose-l-phosphate, which is in turn converted to glucose. As discussed earlier, water now enters the leaf cells,turgorpressure increases and as the guard cells bend, the stomata open. Temperature also fits into this scheme because of its influence on carbon dioxide concentration. An increase in temperature increases the rate of respiration, and so increases in turn the cellular carbon dioxide level. A decrease in temperature, on the other hand, retards respiration, and thus decreases the cellular carbon dioxide levels. It is clear that the stomata are responsive to a complex interplay of factors and are able to respond efficiently to different combinations of these factors.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F10-0253.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Stomata respond to environmental factors such as water loss, light, carbon dioxide concentration, and temperature."}
{"question": "Describe the pathway of electron transport in the respiratory chain.", "solution": "A chain of electron carriers is responsible for transferring electrons through a sequence of steps from molecules such as NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) to molecular oxygen. NADH collects electrons from many different substrates through the action of NAD+ - linked dehydrogenases. For example, NADH is produced from the oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate in glycolysis, and by several dehydrogenations in the citric acid cycle. In the electron transport system, NADH is oxidized to NAD+ with the corresponding reduction of flavin mono-nucleotide (FMN) to FMNH_2. (see Figure 1). Some of the energy released is used for the production of one ATP molecule. Then FMNH_2 is oxidized back to FMN, and the electrons of FMNH_2 are transferred to ubiquinone or coenzyme Q. It is at this site where the electrons of FADH_2 are funneled into the electron transport chain. As ubiquinone is oxidized, the first of a series of cytochromes, cytochrome b, is reduced. The cytochromes are large heme proteins (see Fig. 2). A heme group consists an iron atom surrounded by a flat organic molecule called a porphyrin ring. It is the iron atom of the cytochrome which is oxidized (Fe^3+) or reduced (Fe^2+) . Cytochrome b reduces cytochrome c_1; the energy released is used for the formation of a sec-ond ATP molecule. Cytochrome c_1 reduced to cytochrome c (not shown in figure) which in turn reduces cytochrome a (a complex of cytochromes a and a_3, plus two copper atoms), cytochrome a is oxidized in the last step, with molecular oxygen being the final electron acceptor. As oxygen is reduced to H_2O, a third and last ATP molecule is synthesized. Thus for each NADH molecule entering the respiratory chain, 3 ATP molecules are produced. Therefore, eight NADH molecules give rise to 24 ATP per glucose molecule in the citric acid cycle. Only 4 ATP are produced by the 2 FADH_2 molecules, since they enter the electron transport system at ubiquinone, thus bypassing the first site of ATP synthesis. The two cytoplasmic NADH from glycolysis produce only four ATP instead of six because one ATP is expended per cytoplasmic NADH in order to actively transport NADH across the mitochondrial membrane. By means of the respiratory chain, 32 ATP are produced per glucose mole- cule. The other 4 ATP molecules are produced during substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Thus there is a net yield of 36 ATP per glucose molecule oxidized. (Recall that \"substrate-level\" indicates reactions not involving the electron transport system.)", "images": ["images/F03-0084_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F03-0084.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Electrons are transferred from NADH to molecular oxygen through a chain of electron carriers in the respiratory chain.

Diffusion tends to be faster in gases than in liquids, and much slower in solids. The movement or diffusion of water or solvent molecules through a semipermeablemembrane is called osmosis. The osmotic pressure of a solutionis a measure of the tendency of the solvent to enter the solu-tion byosmosis. The more concentrated a solution, the more water will tend to moveinto it, and the higher is its osmotic pressure.

{"question": "Trace the path of blood through the human heart.", "solution": "The heart is the muscular organ that causes the blood to circulate in the body. The heart of birds and mammals is a pulsatile four-chambered pump composed of an upper left and right atrium (pi., atria) and a lower left and right ventricle. The atria function mainly as entryways to the ventricles, whereas the ventricles supply the main force that propels blood to the lungs and throughout the body. Depending on where the blood is flowing from, it would enter the heart via one of the two veins: the superior vena cava carries blood from the head, neck and arms; the inferior vena cava carries blood from the rest of the body. The blood from these two veins enters the right atrium. When this chamber is filled with blood, the chamber contracts and forces the blood through a valve called the tricuspid valve and into the right ventricle. Since this blood has returned from its cir-culation in the body's tissues, it is deoxygenated and contains much carbon dioxide. It therefore must be transported to the lungs where gas exchange can take place. The right ventricle contracts, forces the blood through the pulmonary semilunar valve into the pulmonary artery. This artery is unlike most arteries in that it carries de-oxygenated blood. The artery splits into two, with one branch lead-ing to each lung. The pulmonary arteries further divide into many arterioles, which divide even further and connect with dense capil-lary networks surrounding the alveoli in the lungs. The alveoli are small sac-like cavities where gas exchange occurs. Carbon dioxide diffuses into the alveoli, where it is expelled, while oxygen is picked up by the hemoglobin of the erythrocytes. The capillaries join to form small venules which further combine to form the four pulmonary veins leading back to the heart. The pulmonary veins are unlike most veins in that they carry oxygenated blood. These veins empty into the left atrium, which contracts to force the blood through the bicuspid (or mitral) valve into the left ventricle. When the left ventricle, filled with blood, contracts, the blood is forced through the aortic semilunar valve into the aorta, the larg-est artery in the body (about 25 millimeters in diameter). The aorta forms an arch and runs posteriorly and inferiorly along the body. Before it completes the arch, the aorta branches into the coronary artery, which carries blood to the muscular walls of the heart itself, the carotid arteries, which carry blood to the head and brain, and the subclavian arteries, which carries blood to the arms. As the aorta runs posteriorly, it branches into arteries which lead various organs such as the liver, kidney, intestines and spleen and also the legs. The arteries divide into arterioles which further divide and become capillaries. It is here that the oxygen and nutrients dif-fuse into the tissues and carbon dioxide and nitrogenous wastes are picked up. The capillaries fuse to form venules which further fuse to become either the superior or inferior vena cava. The entire cycle starts once again. The part of the circulatory system in which deoxygenated blood is pumped to the lungs and oxygenated blood returned to the heart is called the pulmonary circulation. The part in which oxygenated blood is pumped to all parts of the body by the arteries and deoxygenated blood is returned to the heart by the veins is called the systemic circulation.", "images": ["images/F15-0374_files/image002.jpg", "images/F15-0374_files/image004.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F15-0374.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Blood enters the heart via the superior or inferior vena cava into the right atrium, then through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle.

{"question": "Explain why it has been necessary to postulate the existence of a cyclic form of glucose?", "solution": "Glucose (C_6H_12O_6), is one of the isomeric aldohexoses - a carbohydrate or sugar. Glucose exists in two forms, one of which is the mirror image of the other. Its configurational formulas may be written At one time, it was believed that these glucose isomers existed in this linear form. Now, however, it is believed that cyclic forms exist, as indicated in the accompanying diagram. This has been postulated for the following reasons: It has been found that when you take a solution of pure (+) - glucose or a solution of pure (-) - glucose form, a pair of optical isomers are obtained, i.e., ones with the ability to rotate plane- polarized light. For this to occur, in a solution of pure (+) or (-) glucose, another asymmetric carbon must be present. An asymmetric carbon is one with 4 different atoms or molecules attached. Asymmetric carbons can generate optical isomers. In the formation of cyclic structures, the carbon atom of the aldehyde group (C = O) must be the additional asymmetric carbon. This would account for the two optical isomers formed. In other words, that glucose exists in cyclic forms was deduced from the fact that only in such a structure is an additional asymmetric carbon generated, which would account for the optical somers produced.", "images": ["images/E23-0834_files/image002.jpg", "images/E23-0834_files/image004.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E23-0834.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Glucose exists in cyclic forms was deduced from the fact that only in such a structure is an additional asymmetric carbon generated, which would account for the optical somers produced."}
{"question": "Explain the following statements. (1) An impulse will be initiated only when the stimulus is of a certain intensity. (2) Although a neuron exhibits all-or-none response, an animal is able to detect different degrees of intensity of a stimulus.", "solution": "The two statements above come from experiments done on an isolated nerve. Two electrodes are placed at points several centimeters apart on the surface of a nerve. The electrodes are connected to recording devices, which are able to detect any electrical changes that may occur at the points on the nerve the electrodes are in contact with. An extremely mild electrical stimulus is applied to the nerve initially. The recording device shows no change. Next, a slightly more intense stimulus is applied, and still there is no change. The intensity of the stimulus is increased further and this time the device records sin electrical change occurring at the point of the membrane in contact with the first electrode and a fraction f a second later, a similar electric change at the point in contact with the second electrode. The nerve is now stimulated, as evidenced by the wave of electrical changes that moves down the fiber, passing first one electrode and then the other. This shows that an impulse, will be generated in a nerve fiber only if the stimulus reaches a certain intensity. If a more intense stimulus is applied next, an impulse is again triggered and a wave of electrical changes moves down the nerve. However, the intensity and speed of this impulse are the same as those of the one recorded from the previous stimulation. Based on these experiments, we are ready to account for the two statements. (1) A potential stimulus must be above a critical intensity if it is to generate an action potential. This critical intensity is known as the threshold value, and it varies in different neurons. Physiologically, what happens is that below the threshold value, the membrane permeability to sodium ions, though increased, is still less than that of potassium ions. This means that the inside of the membrane is still too negative, and no action potential is generated. Only when the intensity of the stimulus reaches the thresh-old value does the membrane permeability of Na^+ ions in-crease so much that its inflow exceeds the potassium out-flow. This inflow of sodium ions is now sufficient to depo-larize the membrane potential to a critical level, known as the threshold potential. Consequently, an action potential is triggered. Once threshold depolarization is reached, the action potential is no longer dependent upon stimulus strength. Thus, action potentials generated by threshold stimuli are identical to those generated by above-threshold (or suprathreshold) stimuli. (2) Increasing the intensity of the stimulus above the threshold value does not alter the intensity or speed of the nervous impulse produced, that is, the nerve fires maximally or not at all, a type of reaction commonly called an all-or-none response. An animal can detect the different degrees of intensity of a stimulus in two ways. The more intense the stimulus, the more frequent are the impulses moving along the fiber. This is called the frequency code. Second, a more intense stimulus ordinarily stimulates a greater number of nerve fibers than does a weak stimulus. This is called re-cruitment or the population code. Hence, the frequency of firing of impulses and the number of axons stimulated can be interpreted by the brain, and the strength of the stimulus can be detected.", "images": ["images/F20-0528_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F20-0528.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "A potential stimulus must be above a critical intensity, known as the threshold value, to generate an action potential.

In the program, the array B is declared as having 6ele-ments . The GET LIST statement gets the value of Z from the DATA CARD asZ = 6. Also, the value of C is obtained from the DATA CARD as C = 'ROVE'. In the next statement, viz., DO I = 1 TO Z, the value of Z = 6 gets substituted. Hence, the DO loop statement becomes DO I = 1 TO 6;. This means that the DO loop will be performed 6 times. Each time., thevalue of an array element B(I) is calculated. This value ofB(I) = SUBSTR(C,1,I) means that from C, i.e., from 'ROVE', starting from the first character, select I characters. These selectedI characters are to be assigned to B(I). Thus, for example, if 1 = 2, then SUBSTR(C,1,2) gives B (2) = 'RO'. In the given program, as Z = 6, the loop will be perform-ed 6 times. But, during the 5th loop, on substituting values ofIand C in the equation: B(I) = SUBSTR(C,1,I) , gives: B(5) = SUBSTR ('ROVE',1,5). The above statement tries to find a substring of 'ROVE', starting fromthe first character up to (and including) the fifth character. However, 'ROVE' has only 4 characters. Hence, the computer will just print the available characters. The programmermust be informed. Hence, the computer is pro-grammed to printout a message stating that the STRINGRANGE CONDITION had occurredin a certain program statement of the program. b) The printout of the program will be as follows: 1'R ' 2'RO ' 3'ROV ' 4'ROVE ' 5'ROVE ' 6'ROVE ' c) The program can be corrected as follows: The computer must be told thatit must look out for the STRINGRANGE CON-DITION.

{"question": "Describe briefly the Darwin-Wallace theory of natural selection. What is meant by \"survival of the fittest\"? Do you thinkthis applies to human populations today?", "solution": "The Darwin-Wallace theory of natural selection states that a significantpart of evolution is dictated by natural forces, which select for survivalthose organisms that can respond best to them. Since more organismsare born than can be accommodated by the environment, there mustbe chosen among the large numbers born the limited number to live andreproduce. Variation is characteristic of all animals and plants, and it isthis variety which provides the means for this choice. Those individuals whoare chosen for survival will be the ones with the most and best adaptivetraits. These include the ability to compete successfully for food, water, shelter, and other essential elements, also the ability to reproduce andperpetuate the species, and the ability to resist adverse natural forces, which are the agents of selection. Essential to the theory of natural selection are the ideas of the \"strugglefor existence\" and \"survival of the fittest\". Because the resources ofthe environment are naturally limited, individuals must struggle among themselvesfor food and space. Those individuals with the traits that are bestsuited for the given environment will survive and multiply, while otherswill slowly decline in number or disappear completely. Since the naturalforces are constantly operating and changing, struggle for survival goeson forever and the fittest of the competitors survive. Survival of the fittest holds true for human popu-lations, but it is less obviousamong human beings than lower organisms. Whereas it is commonto see wild dogs fighting each other for a piece of food, it is less commonto see two human beings fighting for the same reason. Among humanbeings, the problems of food and shelter have been conquered successfully, such as by farming or by raising cattle. Actual physical strugglebetween human beings for food has become less important. The traitsof strong muscles, great agility and alertness, and other fighting abilitiesthat were once important to the cavemen have more or less lost theirsignificance today.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F27-0716.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The Darwin-Wallace theory of natural selection states that evolution is dictated by natural forces, which select for survival those organisms that can respond best to them.

{"question": "What basic nutritional requirements do all livingorganisms have in common?

These requirements must be known in order to cultivate microorganisms in the laboratory, and purecul- tures may be obtained through the preparation of appropriate selective growth media. All organisms require a source of energy. Green plants and some bacteria can utilize radiant energy (from the sun) and are thus called phototrophs . Animals and non-photosyn-thetic bacteria must rely on the oxidation of chemical compounds for energy and are thus called chemotrophs . All organisms require a carbon source. Plants and many bacteria require only carbon dioxide as their carbon source. They are termed autotrophs . Animals and other bacteria require a more reduced form of carbon , such as an organic carbon compound. Sugars and other carbohydrates are examples of organic carbon compounds. Organisms which have this requirement are termed theterotrophs. They depend upon autotrophs for their organic form of carbon, which they use as both a carbon source and an energy source. All organisms require a nitrogen source. Plants utilize nitrogen in the form of inorganic salts such as potassium nitrate (KNO_3), while animals must rely on organic nitrogen- containing compounds such as amino acids. Most bacteria utilize nitrogen in either of the above forms, although some bacteria can use atmospheric nitrogen. All organisms require sulfur and phosphorous. While phosphorous is usually supplied by phosphates, sulfur may be supplied by organic compounds , by inorganic compounds, or by elementary sulfur.

Assuming complete decomposition, determine the composition of the original mixture.", "solution": "The solution of this problem involves the use of the mole concept and the ability to employ it using chemical (balanced) equations. You need to determine the number of moles of the gases generated from the masses given and their molecular weights. A mole = mass in grams /molecular weight. Once this is known, you can calcu-late the number of moles of substances in the mixture that had to exist to produce the given quantities. You proceed as follows: The only source of the 18 g of H_2 O is from 2KHCO_3 \\rightarrow K_2 O + H_2 O + 2CO_2. The molecular weight of H_2 O = 18. Thus, you have 18 g/18 g/mole = 1 mole of H_2 O. But the equation states that for every mole of H_2 O, you originally had 2 moles of KHCO_3. Therefore, the mixture must have had 2 moles of KHCO_3. The molecular weight of KHCO_3 is 100.1 g. There-fore, the weight in grams of it was 2(100.1) = 200.21 g. The O_2 is generated from only the reaction 2KClO_3 \\rightarrow 2KCl + 3O_2. You have 40 g of O_2 evolved. Molecular weight of O_2 = 32. Thus you have 40/32 = 1.25 moles of O_2. According to the equation, for every 3molesof O_2 produced, there existed 2 moles of KClO_3. Thus, you have 2/3 (1.25) or .833molesof KClO_3. Molecular weight of KClO_3 = 122.6. Therefore, the number of grams = (122.6) (.833) = 102.1 g The CO_2 gas has two sources : 2KHCO_3 \\rightarrow K_2 O + H_2 O + 2CO_2andK_2 CO_3 \\rightarrow K_2 O + CO_2. From the water evolved, you already know that you have 200.21 g of KHCO_3. Its molecular weight is 100.1 g. Thus, the number of moles of it is, 200.2/100.1 = 2. From the equation, however, you see that for every 2 moles of KHCO_3, you obtain 2 moles of CO_2. Maintaining this one to one ratio, 2molesof CO_2 must be generated. The molecular weight of CO_2 is 44. Thus, from KHCO_3, 2(44) = 88 g of CO_2 produced. The total number of grams CO_2 evolved was given as 132 g. This means, therefore, that the other source of CO_2, K_2 CO_3, must give off 132 - 88 = 44 grams of CO_2. You have K_2 CO_3 \\rightarrow K_2 O + CO_2 This equation shows a 1 : 1 mole ratio between K_2 CO_3 and CO_2. You have 44 grams of CO_2 released or 1 mole, since the molecular weight of CO_2 is 44. Therefore, you must have 1 mole of K_2 CO_3 in the mixture. The molecular weight of K_2 CO_3 is 138.21.Thus,thenumber of grams is (1) (138.21) for K_2 CO_3 = 138.21 g. In summary, you have 200.14 g of KHCO_3, 102.12 g of KCIO_3 and 138.21 g of K_2 CO_3. The total mass of these substances = 440.47 g. The original mixture was 1000 g.

{"question": "Why do some viruses contain only one type of protein in their protective coat?", "solution": "The nucleic acid in a virus particle is surrounded by a protein coat, called a capsid, made up of protein subunits called capsomeres. A complete virus particle is called a virion and it may be covered by an envelope. Those that do not have envelopes are termed naked virions, while those virions that do have envelopes are termed enveloped. A typical naked and an enveloped virion are shown in Fig.1. Some of the protein coats are complex, containing numerous layers and various different proteins. Some also include lipid and carbohydrate molecules. Others, however, contain only one or a few types of protein molecules in their coats. The use of a large number of identical proteins in the protective coat of viruses is often mandatory. The extremely small viruses have a limited nucleic acid content which restricts the total number of amino acidsthat can be used to synthesize its protein. For example, there are approximately 6000 nucleotides in a TMV RNA chain. The TMV RNA can therefore code for a protein 2000 amino acids in length. (Three nucleotides are needed to code for one amino acid.) Since each amino acid weighs about 125 daltons (a dalton is a unit of weight equal to the weight of a single hydrogen atom), this protein molecule of 2000 amino acids should weigh 2.5 \u00d7 10^5 daltons. However, since we know the protein coat of TMV weighs 3.5 \u00d7 10^7 dal- tons, about 140 (3.5 \u00d7 10^7 \\div 2.5 \u00d7 10^5) of these protein molecules would be needed. The virus does not use all its nucleic acids to code for a single protein. Since only a very small part of the RNA chain codes for the coat protein, the proteins consist of fewer amino acids. Therefore, many smaller identical protein molecules are used to construct the protein coat.

{"question": "At standard conditions, 1 liter of oxygen gas weighs almost 1.44 g, whereas 1 liter of hydrogen weighs only .09 g. Which gas diffuses faster? Calculate how much faster.", "solution": "This question deals with diffusion of gases, which is governed by Graham's law. A gas that has a high density diffuses more slowly than one with a lower density. The rates of diffusion of 2 gases are inversely proportional to the square roots of their densities, as shown by the equation r_1 / r_2 = \\surdd_2 / \\surdd_1 ,where r_1, r_2 = rates of diffusion of the gases, and d_1, d_2 are their respective densities. Therefore, by Graham's law, we know that H_2 diffuses faster because of its lower density. (H_2's density = M / V = (.09 g) / (1 l) =.09 g/ l while O_2's density = 1.44 / 1 = 1.44 g/liter.) To find out how much faster H_2 diffuses, plug the necessary factors into the equation r_(H)2 / r_(O)2 = \\surd(d_(O)2) / \\surd(d_(H)2).Rewriting, r_(H)2 = r_(O)2 [\\surd(d_(O)2) / \\surd(d_(H)2)] = r_(O)2[\\surd(1.44) / \\surd(.09) ] r_(H)2 = 4r_(O)2 Thus, the calculated comparison is in agreement with the predicted comparison that H_2 diffuses more quickly.

{"question": "Distinguish betweenCebidae(New World monkeys) and Cercopithecidae (Old World monkeys).", "solution": "The first members of the suborderAnthropoi-deadiverged from the prosimians during the Oligocene era. Theprosimiansare the earliest known primates in evolutionary history. Two lines of anthropoid monkeys (CatarrhinesandPlatyrrhines) , probably arose at about the same time from closely relatedprosimianancestors. One of the lines (Platyrrhines) gave rise to the super familyCeboideaand the other line (Catarrhine) gave rise to the twosuperfamiliesCercopithecoideaandHominoidea. TheCebidaeis a family grouping in the super familyCeboidea, and is therefore a New World monkey. In addition to theCebidae, there is another family in thesuperfamilyCeboidea, theCallithricidaeor marmosets. The familyCercopithecidaeis in thesuperfamily Cercopithecoidea and are thus Old World monkeys. The family from which man descended is theHominidaewhich is in thesuperfamilyHominoidea, the second lineage ofcatarrhinemonkeys. The members of the familyCebidaeare New World monkeys, with the adjective \"New World\" referring to their presence in South America and Central America. Theceboids, isolated in South America, underwent evolution independent of the members of theCercopithecoideaand Hominoidea . Among the livingceboidsare the howler monkey, the marmoset (squirrel monkey), the capuchin monkey (organ grinder's monkey) and the spider monkey. All these monkeys are found in tropical forest habitats and show a wide variety of adaptations to arboreal life, some of which parallel those of the Old World monkeys. Thecercopithe- coids are Old World Monkeys, \"Old World\" referring to their widespread distribution in Africa and Southeast Asia. The large group of Old World monkeys includes the macaque, mandrill,mangabey, baboon,langur, proboscis monkeys and others. They live in a variety of environments, both arboreal and terrestrial, from grassland savannas to jungle forests. The New World and Old World monkeys differ in many ways and most differences are readily observable. Most New World monkeys, have a prehensile tail that they use almost like another hand for grasping objects and hanging from trees. The prehensile tail has a tactile pad at the tip with ridge patterns similar to fingerprints. The tail of the Old World monkeys is not prehensile, but is used instead for balance. The nostrils of theCeboidea(New World monkeys) are separated by a wide partition, and are flat and facing in a lateral (outward) position. This condition is known asplatyrrhini, hence the nameplatyrrhinimonkey. Theceboidsare allplatyrrhinimonkeys. The nostrils of thecercopithecoidsand hominoids are closer together and are directed downward and forward. This condition is known ascatarrhini, and thus primates with nostrils of this type are calledcatarrhinemonkeys. Thecercopithecoidsand hominoids are all classified ascatarrhinemonkeys. New World monkeys have no adaptations for terrestrial life styles. Old World monkeys tend to sit upright, and have buttocks with a hardened, insensitive sitting pad called the ischial callosities. Theischialcallosities is usually very brightly colored, being either red or blue. Old World monkeys possess distinctive molars (cheek teeth), which can be used to distinguish them from the New World monkeys. These are known as thebilophodentmolars. Furthermore Old World monkeys have a bony auditory tube which New World monkeys do not have.

{"question": "Define the term catalyst. Give an example of an inorganic catalyst and of an organic catalyst.", "solution": "A catalyst is a substance which affects the speed of a chemical reaction without affecting its final equilibrium point. The addition of a catalyst enables the reaction to reach equilibrium at a faster rate than it otherwise would. A catalyst is not incorporated into the products of the reaction and hence is capable of being regenerated. To understand how a catalyst speeds up a chemical reaction, it is first necessary to define the activation energy of a reaction. There is usually an energy barrier to every chemical reaction which prevents the reaction from spontaneously occurring, even if the reaction is exergonic, that is, one with a negative \u2206G (a decrease in free energy). This energy barrier is called the activation energy (Ea). One way to overcome the energy barrier, is through the addition of heat. This increases the internal energy content and therefore the frequency of collisions and reactions. A catalyst can also overcome the energy barrier by lowering the activation energy, and thereby increasing the number of molecules with a suffi-cient energy content to react and form a product. The catalyst acts by forming an unstable intermediate complex with the reactants. This complex is subsequently trans-formed into the product with the release of the catalyst. (C + R)\\rightleftharpoonsC \\textbullet R\\rightleftharpoons(C + P) (catalyst + reactant)(complex)(catalyst + product) The catalyst is therefore free to complex with a second molecule of the reactant. The intermediate complex formed provides an alternative pathway of reaction with a corres-pondingly lower activation energy, thus enabling the reaction to proceed at a faster rate. Figure showing a higher activation energy for an uncata-lyzed reaction than for a catalyzed reaction, note that \u2206G remains the same for both types of reactions. There are both inorganic catalysts and organic catalysts. Most inorganic catalysts are non-specific, i.e., they will catalyze various similar reactions. For example, platinum black will catalyze any reaction involving H_2, since it serves to weaken, the bond between the hydrogen atoms. Other inorganic catalysts include water, iron, nickel, and palladium. On the other hand, organic catalysts such as enzymes are highly selective as to the reactions they will catalyze. The specific molecules which an enzyme will bind to and react with are called substrates. There are many enzymes synthesized by living cells, all with specific functions and names. An example of an organic catalyst is sucrase, which is the enzyme that hydrolyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose. Other important enzymes include lysozyme, chymotrypsin, trypsin, and elastase.", "images": ["images/F03-0065_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F03-0065.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "A catalyst is a substance which affects the speed of a chemical reaction without affecting its final equilibrium point.

{"question": "Name the two basic classes of electronic computers. Give the basic similarities and differences between them.", "solution": "The two main classes of electronic computers are analog and digital, although analog computers are seldom used these days. The analog computers use continuous electrical quan-tities such as voltages, currents, capacitances, etc. to repre-sent the continuous real-world quantities such as temperature, pressure, mass, and so on. For example, 1 + 1 = 2 may be repre-sented as 1 volt + 1 volt = 2 volts using appropriate circuitry. On the other hand, a more complicated mechanical system shown in Figure 1-2a may be represented by the electrical circuit shown in Figure 1 - 2b. Figure 1-2. Representation of A Problem by Analog Computer. The general equation of oscillation for the mechanical system is given by: {MD + F + (1 / KD)} X = 0, where D is called the differential operator, and X is the posi-tion of the weight at any moment. After the switch is closed, the equation of the electrical oscillation will take the form: {LD + R (1 / CD)} I = 0, where D is same as before, and I is the current at any moment. Note that these two equations are identical, except for some of the letters used. Therefore, the behavior of the two systems will be identical. Although analog computers are good in solving problems that involve continuous quantities, the representation is not always easy and the accuracy is in doubt. For example, an analog com-puter calculates the interest on a million-dollar loan, the result could be off by at least a few dollars. The accountant who must reckon every penny may not be satisfied with that kind of result. The digital computer deals with numbers represented inter-nally as a sequence of binary digits (or bits). The architecture and operation of these systems are detailed throughout this chapter. Although a digital computer cannot directly represent and solve the above problem whose nature is continuous, it can be programmed to solve the problem through a mathematical proce-dure. Moreover, the results will be as accurate as the math-ematical formulation allows. In the case of interest calcula-tions on a million-dollar loan, the result will be accurate down to the pennies, except for possible round-off error that is really the property of mathematical solution procedure and not the fault of the digital computer. The digital computers have advantages of programmability with reliable accuracy, since exactly the same result will be obtained the next time the program is executed. The analog com-puter may sometimes have advantage in solving continuous type problems in a direct way to produce results that are not precise but acceptable for all practical purposes. The similarity be-tween the two classes of computers is the fact that both are electromechanical machines. The difference is that the digital computers, sometimes at the expense of extra storage and fre-quency bandwidths (e.g. more complex electronic signals), are more reliable and accurate.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G01-0006.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The two main classes of electronic computers are analog and digital."}

Outline the sequence of events leading to the destruction of the virus.", "solution": "The first line of defense against invading pathogens, such as viruses, is the skin and mucous mem-branes. If this line is broken, the second defense mechanism,phagocytosis, takes over. If the virus breaks this line of defense, it enters the circulatory system. Its presence here stimulates specific white blood cells, the lymphocytes, to produce antibodies. These anti-bodies combine specifically with the virus to prevent it from further spreading. Any substance, such as a virus, which stimulates antibody synthesis is called an antigen. Antibodies are not produced because the body realizes that the virus will produce a disease, but because the virus is a foreign sub-stance. An individual is \"immune\" to a virus or any antigen as long as the specific antibody for that antigen is present in the circulatory system. The study of antigen-antibody interactions is called immunology. The basic sequence of events leading to the destruc-tion of the virus is similar to most antigen-antibody in-teractions.

If you have a current of .01 amp, how long can the current flow if the battery contains 25.0g of a paste of MnO_2 , NH_4Cl, and ZnCl_2 of which 20% is MnO_2 ?", "solution": "A standard flashlight dry cell, or Leclanche cell, is composed of a graphite rod in a moist MnO_2 - ZnCl_2- NH_4Cl paste, all in a zinc wrapper. The zinc wrapper serves as the electrode for the oxidation half-- cell (the anode), while the graphite rod is the electrode for the reduc-tion half-cell (the cathode).

The net reaction for the overall process is Zn(s) + 2MnO_2 \\rightarrow ZnO \\bullet Mn_2O_3 . To determine how long the current can flow, calculate the number of moles of MnO_2 present and the number of Faraday's required to reduce it per mole. You are told that 20% of 25 grams of paste is MnO_2.Thus, you have (.20)(25g) = 5.0g of MnO_2 .The molecular weight of MnO_2 = 86.94g . Thus, you have (5g) / (86.94g /mole) = .0575 moles of MnO_2 . From the net equation, you see that 2 electrons are transferred. A Faraday = 96,500 coul and is capable of reducing one equivalent posi-tive charge, which means Avogardro's number of individual unit charges (one mole of electrons). Since 2 electrons were transferred per 2 moles, it takes 2 Faraday's to reduce 2 moles of MnO_2 .

In basic assembler language, by means of a BALR instruction, the address of the first instruction of the program is al-ways placed in a base register. We can safely say that this address never has location \"zero.\" This is so because the first section of the computer's memory is reserved for the operating system. If we call the address at which the pro-gram is loaded its ENTRY address, then, in general, to cal-culate the address of any of the program's symbols, we must add the distance (number of bytes) that is between the sym-bol and the ENTRY address to the ENTRY address. For example if the ENTRY address' location is 925 and the symbol is 48 bytes away, then the address of the symbol is 925 + 48 = 973; the symbol is at location 973. The ENTRY address and the process of adding the displacement dictate what is known as the absolute address of the program and its symbols. In fact, the absolute address of a symbol is its actual loca-tion in main memory. In relative addressing however, we are only interested in the positions which statements occupy relative to the beginning of the program. As a result of this we do not concern ourselves with the contents of the base register (since it is constant for all statements in the program) in calculating this address. The relative address is merely the distance of a particular statement from the beginning of the program.

{"question": "A solution of 10.0 g of HF in 500 g H_2O freezes at - 1.98\\textdegreeC. Calculate the degree of ionization of HF. (M.W. HF = 20.0 The Freezing point depression of H_2O is 1.86\\textdegree.)", "solution": "When an acid is dissolved in solution, it dissociates into ions. For example, when one mole of HF is dissolved in H_2O, one mole of H^+ and one mole of F^- are present after complete dissociation. The freezing point of a solution is dependent on the number of particles in the solution, which means that the freezing point of a solution will be lowered more by a compound which ionizes than by the same amount of a compound which does not ionize. The degree of ionization of a compound is a measure of what percent of the compound is ionized when it is placed in a particular solution. In this problem, one is told that when 10 g of HF is added to 500 g of H_2O the original freezing point of the water (0\\textdegree) is lowered to - 1.98\\textdegreeC. The freezing point depression is related to the concentration of particles in the solution by the statement freezing point depression =molality\u00d7 freezing point constant The freezing point constant of water is 1.86\\textdegree. This means that one mole of a substance (except those substances which ionize) dissolved in 1000 g of water lowers the freezing point 1.86\\textdegree. Since HF ionizes, we cannot use itsmolalityin this equation. You can use the effectivemolality, which is the sum of themolalitiesof H^+, F^- and HF. Themolalityof H^+ and F^- will be equal to the degree of ionization of the HF. The concentrations of H^+ and F^- will be equal because, when HF ionizes, one H^+ and one F^- will be formed. This reaction is given by the equation HF \\leftrightarrows H^+ + F^- To solve for the degree of ionization of HF, one must: (a) find the molalityof HF as if it were not ionized, (b) define a variable for the molalitiesof H^+ and F^- ; here, x will be used, (c) find themolalityof HF after ionization is taken into account, (d) find the effectivemolalityof the species, (e) use the effectivemolalityin the freezing point depression equation to solve for x, themolalityof H^+ and F^- . (a) Themolalityof HF before ionization. Themolalityis defined as the number of moles of solute in 1000 g of solvent. The number of moles of HF can be found by dividing the number of grams present by the molecular weight. number of moles = [(number of grams)/(molecular weight)] moles of HF = [(10.0 g)/(20.0 g/mole)] = 0.5 moles Themolalitycan now be found by dividing the number of moles of HF by the number of kg of water present. molality= [(no. of moles of HF)/(no. of kg of H_2O)] molality= [(0.5moles)/(0.500 kg)] = 1.0 moles/kg (b) x =molalityof H^+ =molalityof F^- (c) After ionization of xmolalof H^+ and F^-, themolalityof HF will be 1.0 - x. (e) The effectivemolalityof the species will be equal to the sum of themolalitiesof all of the species present. The effectivemolality=molalityof H^+ +molalityof F^- +molalityof HF effectivemolality= x + x + (1.0 - x) = 1.0 + x.

{"question": "Metallic gold crystallizes in the face-centered cubic lattice. The length of the cubic unit cell, a, is 4.070 \\AA. (a) What is the closest distance between gold atoms?

Every lattice, is a three-dimensional stacking of identical building blocks called unit cells. The most symmetrical crystals have cubic lattices. There are three kinds of elementary cubic lattices: the simple cubic, the face- centered cubic, and the body-centered cubic. The length of the cube edge is designated by the symbol a. In a face-centered lattice, an atom would be located at each corner of the unit cell and at the center of each of the six faces. (a) In the gold crystal above, the closest distance from one corner atom to another corner atom is a, 4.070 \\AA.

{"question": "What is meant by embryonic development? Describe the various stages of embryonic development.", "solution": "Embryonic development begins when an ovum is fertilized by a sperm and ends at parturition (birth). It is a process of change and growth which transforms a single cell zygote into a multicellular organism. The earliest stage of embryonic development is the one-celled, diploid zygote which results from the fer-tilization of an ovum by a sperm. Next is a period called cleavage, in which mitotic division of the zygote results in the formation of daughter cells called blastomeres. At each succeeding division, the blastomeres become smaller and smaller. When 16 or so blastomeres have formed, the solid ball of cells is called a morula. As the morula divides further, a fluid-filled cavity is formed in the center of the sphere, converting the morula into a hollow ball of cells called a biastula. The fluid filled cavity is called the blastocoel. When cells of the blastula differentiate into two, and later three, embryonic germ layers, the blastula is called a gastrula. The gastrula period generally extends until the early forms of all major structures (for example, the heart) are laid down. After this period, the de-veloping organism is called a fetus. During the fetal period (the duration of which varies with different spec-ies) , the various systems develop further. Though de-velopmental changes in the fetal period are not as dramatic as those occurring during the earlier embryonic periods, they are extremely important.

{"question": "When a swimmer leaves cold water on a warm, breezy day, he experiences a cooling effect.

When the swimmer leaves the cold water, he is, coated with water. As the water evaporates a layer of gaseous water molecules form around the swimmer's body. This vapor attains an equilibrium with the atmosphere which hinders further vaporization of the water. However, when the breeze comes, it blows away the vapor above the water, and thereby keeps the partial pressure of the vapor low above the skin. This, then, causes increased evapora-tion so that the partial pressure can be reestablished. This is true because the concentration and vapor pressure of the gaseous water, molecules must be below a certain point for evaporation to occur. Once thisponthas been reached no more liquid molecules of water can go into the gaseous state. For the water to evaporate, it must go from a liquid to a gaseous phase, a process which requires heat.

{"question": "Why does a physician advise reduced salt intake in cases of hypertension?", "solution": "Hypertension or high blood pressure, is caused by abnormalities in arterial pressure regulation. The mean arterial pressure (M.A.P.) is the average pressure throughout the pressure pulse cycle. It is not equal to the average of the systolic and diastolic pressure, since the heart remains in diastole twice as long as in systole. M.A.P. = [(SBP + 2DBP) / 3] = [{120 + 2(80)} / 3] = 93.3 Thus mean arterial pressure is closer to the diastolic than to the systolic blood pressure. Arterial pressure is determined by two factors: cardiac output and total peripheral resistance. The relationship between them is: Pressure = Cardiac Output \u00d7 Total Peripheral Resistance Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped by each ventricle per unit time, and is determined by both the heart rate and the stroke volume. Total peripheral resistance is the resistance of the entire systemic circulation. Any factor that causes an increase in cardiac output or total peripheral resistance will cause an increase in mean arterial pressure. One such factor is the secretion of the hormonealdosteroneby the adrenal cortex.Aldosteroneacts on the tubules of the kidney to increase thereabsorptionof sodium. This increased retention of sodium causes more water to be retained, thereby increasing the volume of the blood. This increased blood volume increases the stroke volume and hence the cardiac output. Arterial blood pressure increases. When excessive aldosteroneis secreted (such as by a tumor in the adrenal cortex), hypertension results. Salt, or sodium chloride, is a source of sodium. A decreased salt intake causes less water to be retained, decreasing blood volume, and in turn lowering blood pressure. Blood pressure can also be increased by vasoconstriction (constriction of the blood vessels). Constriction causes an increased resistance to flow (since a decrease in vessel radius increases vascular resistance). A protein calledangiotensinII causes both vasoconstriction and stimulation ofaldosteroneproduction and secretion.AngiotensinII is producedenzymaticallyfromangiotensinI, which is converted from angiotensinogen, a glycoprotein made in the liver. The enzyme rennin, formed in the kidney, catalyzes this conversion. Kidney damage can cause anoversecretionof rennin, which causes an increase of angiotensinII, and thus hypertension. Slight hypertension usually accompanies arteriosclerosis, the deposition of fatty material (such as cholesterol) in the arterial walls. The arteries become fibrous and calcified. This buildup of deposits inhibits the flow of blood, increasing resistance to flow and thus increasing the blood pressure needed to overcome the resistance. Oversecretionof rennin andaldosteroneand arteriosclerosis can thus cause hypertension, but in most cases (90%), the cause is unknown. These cases, known as \\textquotedblleftessential\\textquotedblright hypertension (because of unknown etiology) appear to be hereditary. Hypertension is harmful because it increases the work load of the heart and damages the arteries by subjecting them to excessive pressure.

{"question": "How are fungi important to man?", "solution": "Fungi are divided into four groups:Oomycetes(Oomycota)- the egg fungi,Zygomycetes(Zygomycota)\\rule{1em}{1pt}Zygo-spore-forming fungi, Ascomycetes (Ascomycota)-the sac fungi, andBasidiomycetes (Basidiomycota)-the club fungi. Fungi are both beneficial and detrimental to man. Bene-ficial fungi are great importance commercially.Ascomycetes, or sac fungi, are used routinely in food production. Yeasts, members of this group, are utilized in liquor and bread man-ufacture. All alcohol production relies on the ability of yeasts to degrade glucose to ethanol and carbon dioxide, when they are grown in the absence of oxygen. Yeasts used in alco-hol production continue to grow until the ethanol concentration reaches about 13 percent. Wine, champagne, and beer are not concentrated any further. However, liquors such as whiskey or vodka are then distilled, so that the ethanol concentration reaches 40 to 50 percent. The different types of yeasts used in wine production are in part responsible for the distinctive flavors of different wines. Bread baking relies on CO_2 pro-duced by the yeasts which causes the dough to rise. Yeasts used in baking and in the brewing of beer are cultivated yeasts, and are carefully kept as pure strains to prevent contamination. Sac fungi of genusPenicilliumare used in cheese production. They are responsible for the unique flavor of cheeses such as Roquefort and Camembert. The medically important antibiotic penicillin is also produced by members of this genus. CertainAscomycetesare edible. These include the delicious morels and truffles. The club fungi, orBasidiomycetes, are of agricultural importance. Mushrooms are members of this group. About 200 species of mushrooms are edible while a small number are poi-sonous. The cultivated mushroom, Agaricus campestris, differs from its wild relatives, and is grown commercially. Fungi are often of agricultural significance in that they can seriously damage crops. Members of theOomycetes, also known as water molds, cause plant seedling diseases, downy mildew of grapes, and potato blight (this was the cause of the Irish potato famine). Mildew is a water mold that grows parasitically on damp, shaded areas. Rhizopusstolonifer, a member of theZygomycetes, is known as black bread mold. Once very common, it is now controlled by refrigeration and by additives that inhibit mold growth. TheAascomyceteClaviceps purpurea causes the disease ergot, which occurs in rye and other cereal plants and results in ergot poi-soning of humans and livestock. This type of poisoning may be fatal. The disease caused in humans is called St.Vitus's dance Visual hallucinations are a common symptom of this disease. Lysergic acid is a constituent of ergot and is an intermediate in the synthesis of LSD. The \"dance macabre\" of the Middle Ages is now believed to have been caused by ergot poisoning. Basidiomycetes are also responsible for agricultural dam-age. Certain club fungi are known as smuts and rusts. Smuts damage crops such as corn, and rusts damage cereal crops such as wheat. Bracket fungi, another type of club fungi, cause enormous economic losses by damaging wood of both living trees and stored lumber. Fungi are also important to man because of the diseases they cause in man and livestock.Candidaalbicanscauses a throat and mouth disease, \"thrush\", and also infects the mucous membranes of the lungs and genital organs.

{"question": "Derive a relation describing the interference effects observed Derive a relation describing the interference effects observed when light is reflected from a thin film. (See figure).", "solution": "In order to understand the interference effects produced by a thin film, we trace the path of an incident ray of light, as shown in figure (a). The incident ray first encounters surface A, where it is partially reflected and partially absorbed. Since the refractive index of the film is greater than the refractive index of air, the reflected ray undergoes a 180\\textdegree phase change. The transmitted part of the incident ray now encounters interface B, where it is partially reflected and par-tially absorbed. However, this time the reflected ray undergoes no phase change since it is traveling from a region of high refractive index to a region of low refractive index. Hence, rays 1 and 2 differ in phase by 180\\textdegree , or \\lambda_0/2where \\lambda_0 is the wavelength of the incident light in free space. In addition to the 180 phase change due to reflection, ray 2 tra-vels a distance 2t greater than ray 1. (This holds only if the rays shown are incident at an angle \\o which is very small.) Then, if we want to observe destructive interference, the distance 2t must contain an integral number of wavelengths, N^\\lambda, where N = 0, 1, 2,... .

{"question": "Why is it that in most ecological successions the last stageis longlasting?", "solution": "If no disruptive factors interfere, most successions eventually reach astage that is much more stable than those that preceded it.

Consequently, it may persist for centuries without being replacedby another stage so long as climate,physiographyand other majorenvironmental factors remain essentially the same. However, a climaxcommunity is not static. It does slowly change and will change rapidlyif there are major shifts in the environment.

{"question": "What are the basic structural and functional differences between white blood cells and red blood cells? Describe two different ways that white blood cells act to protect the body from foreign agents such as microorganisms.", "solution": "In addition to red blood cells, human blood contains five types of white blood cells, or leukocytes. Unlike the red blood cells, all types of leukocytes contain nuclei and do not contain hemoglobin. Leukocytes are generally larger than erythrocytes and are far less numerous. There are approximately 5,400,000 red cells per cubic millimeter of blood in an adult male (4.6 million in females), while only about 7,000 leukocytes per cubic millimeter. There are five different types of leukocytes (see Figure). Leukocytes are classified as granular (eosino-phils, neutrophils and basophils) or angular (monocytes and lymphocytes). The granulocytes have granules in their cytoplasm, have lobed nuclei, and are produced in red bone marrow. The agranulocytes are produced in organs such as the lymph nodes, spleen and thymus. Neutrophils make up over 60% of the leukocytes present in the body. Like other leukocytes, they can squeeze through the pores of blood vessels and enter the tissue spaces. They then move by amoeboid movement to sites of infected tissue. For example, when bacteria enter a certain tissue of the body, they can either attack cells or produce damaging toxins. The blood vessels in the in-fected region dilate and allow more blood flow to the site, causing the heat and redness characteristic of inflammation. Blood vessel permeability also increases, causing fluid to enter the tissue and swelling to result. Neutrophils and monocytes pass through the blood vessels and engulf, ingest and destroy the bacteria. Foreign particles and dead tissue can also be engulfed by this process of phagocytosis. These leukocytes are chemically attracted to the inflamed site by products released from the damaged tissues. The monocytes (5.3%) usually appear after the neutro-phils and are more important in fighting chronic infections. Monocytes can phagocytize bacteria but more often, they en-large and become wandering macrophages, which can move more quickly and engulf more bacteria. Eosinophils (2.3%) are weakly phagocytic, and are involved in aller-gic reactions (by releasing antihistamines) and in fight-ing trichinosis (an infection caused by the parasitic worm, trichinella). Basophils ( .5%) liberate the anti-coagulant heparin which combats the coagulative pro cesses that sometimes occurs in prolonged inflammation. The second means by which leukocytes protect the body from invasion is carried out by the lymphocytes. Lymphocytes (30%) function in the process of immunity. Lymphocytes are involved in the production of anti-bodies, proteins made by the body in response to speci-fic foreign substances. These foreign substances are subsequently attacked and destroyed by the anitbodies. Immunity and its agents will be discussed in further questions. The main functions of the leukocytes are thus protective: phagocytosis and immunity. The major function of the erythrocytes is to carry hemoglobin for gaseous transport and exchange, which is essential to the continuation of cellular metabolic processes.", "images": ["images/F14-0358_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F14-0358.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "White blood cells contain nuclei and do not contain hemoglobin, they are larger and less numerous than red blood cells.

M represents the ratio of the size of the image to the size of the actual object. This relation between p and q is without regard to sign. Since the image is virtual, it lies behind the mirror.

This necessitates de-fining K _dissociation' which is an equilibrium constant HCI and NaC_2H_3O_2 are strong electrolytes, which means that, in solution, they are completely dissociated. You have, therefore, H^+, CI^-, Na^+,and C_2H_3O_2^- ions present in the solution. The Na^+ and CI^- do not associate, and need not be considered. Thus, you must only consider the formationof HC_2H_3O_2 from H^+ and C_2H_3O^- . The equation for this reaction canbe written H^+ + C_2H_3O_2^- \\rightleftarrows HC_2H_3O_2 This reaction can proceed in both directions, an equi-librium exists, as the doublearrow indicates.

For optimal transfer, the mass of the third particle is the geometric mean of the other two.", "solution": "(a) Let the energy of the incoming particle be E, and refer to figure (1) for the system of notation. Since the collision is perfectly elastic, both energy and momentum are conserved. Therefore E = EA+ EBandm_Au = m_AvA+ m_Bv_B. ButE = (1/2) m_Au^2 = (m ^2Au^2) / (2m_A)orm_Au = \\surd(2m_AE), and similarly for the other kinetic energies. The second equation is therefore \\surd(2m_AE) = \\surd(2m_AE_A) + \\surd(2m_BE_B)or \\surdE = \\surd(E_A) + \\surd(xE_B), Wherex = m_B/m_A. Then E = [\\surd(E_A )+ \\surd(xE_B)]^2 = E_A + xE_B + 2\\surd(xE_AE_B) \\thereforeEA+ E_B = E = E_B + xE_B + 2\\surd(xE_AE_B) Transposing, E_A + EB- E_A - xEB= 2\\surd(xE_AE_B) (1 - x) EB= 2\\surd(xE_AE_B) Squaring both sides and using E_A = E - E_B, (1 - x)^2E_B = 4xE_A = 4x(E - E_B). \\thereforeE_B/(E - E_B) = 4x /[(1 - x)^2] Inverting, (E - E_B)/E_B = (E/E_B)- 1 = [(1 - x)^2]/4x E/EB= [{(1 - x)^2}/ 4x] + 1 = [{(1 - x)^2}/ 4x] + (4x/4x) = [{(1 - x)^2 + 4x}/ 4x] Inverting once more so as to get the needed ratio of E_B to E, E_B/ E = 4x/[(1 - x)^2 + 4x] = 4x/[1 + x^2 - 2x + 4x] = 4x/[1 + 2x +x^2] = 4x/(1 + x)^2 For maximum energy transfer, E_B should be as large a proportion of E as For maximum energy transfer, E_B should be as large a proportion of E as possible and (d/dx) (E_B/E) should be zero. Thus, for maximum energy transfer, (d/dx)(E_B/ E) = [4/(1 + x)^2] - [8x/(1 + x)^3 = 0 or4(1 + x) = 8x\\therefore x = 1,[i.e. (m_B/m_A) = 1] Thus, the two masses should be equal when all the energy is transferred to the second particle. (b) If x has a fixed value not equal to 1, insert a further mass m_c between m_A and m_B. Then in the first collision, we have from part (a), E_C/E = 4y/(1 + y)2, where y = m_C /m_A [see Fig. (2)]. Now m_c collides with m_B and E_B/E_C = 4z/(1 + z)2, Where, z = m_B/m_C. but yz = x, and therefore E_B/E_C = [4(x/y)]/[1 + (x/y)]^2. E_B/E = (E_B/E_C) \\bullet (E_C/E) = 16x/[(1 + y)^2{1 + (x/y)}^2]. (d/dy)(E_B/E) = - [32x/{(1 + y)^3[1 + (x/y)]^2}] + [(32x^2/y^2)/{(1 + y)^2[1 + (x/y)]}] For maximum energy transfer to the final mass, this quantity must be zero, and so 32x[1 + (x/y)] = 32x^2/ y2(1 + y) Multiplying by y_2 and cancelling the term 32x, y^2 + xy = x +xyory^2 = x. \\thereforem ^2C/ m ^2_A= m_B/mAorm_C = \\surd(m_Am_B). For maximum energy transfer the intermediate particle must have a mass which is the geometrical mean of the other two. But the first term in the final inequality is the maximum transfer of energy when three particles are involved, using the necessary relation y^2 = x. The second term is the energy transfer when only two particles are involved. Therefore, not only is maximum energy transferred in the three- particle case when m_C = \\surd(mAm_B), but the energy acquired by the particle of mass m_B is greater than it is when only two particles are involved.", "images": ["images/D06-0310_files/image002.gif"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Physics/D06-0310.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "The two masses should be equal when all the energy is transferred to the second particle.

(b) what will the pressure be if the temperature rises to 106\\textdegreeF?", "solution": "(a) Because pressure, volume, and temperature are involved, one thinks of the combined gas law. This law can be stated: For a given mass of gas, the volume is inversely proportional to the pressure and directly proportional to the absolute temperature. This law can be stated algebraically as: (PV/T) = K, where P is the pressure, V is the volume, T is the absolute temperature, and K is a constant. This means that if two of the parameters are changed, the third will adjust itself so that PV/T = K is still true. The following equation is thus true: (P_1 V_1 )/T_1= (P_2 V_2 )/T_2 where P_1 is the original temperature, V_1 is the original volume, T_1 is the original absolute temperature, P_2 is the new pressure, V_2 is the new volume, and T_2 is the new absolute temperature, when V_1 = V_2, as in this problem, it follows from the formula that pressure is directly proportional to absolute temperature. In this case, the law can be written (P_1 /T_2 ) = (P_2 /T_2 ) In this problem, the temperature is given in \\textdegreeF, and must be converted to \\textdegreeK before it is used in the combined gas law.

{"question": "You have an unknown liquid hydrocarbon that may be hexane, 1-hexene or cyclohexene.

A functional group is a group of atoms that characterize a compound's reactions. Thus, to solve this problem, you want to use reactions that clearly distinguish between functional groups. Proceed as follows: Hexane is a saturated hydrocarbon, which means all of its carbons have single bonds and the molecule is made up of carbon and hydrogen only. 1- hexene and cyclohexene both possess a double bond, which means they are unsaturated. A characteristic feature of unsaturated compounds is the fact that they undergo addition reactions. Thus, if you add CI_2 in CCl_4, you get addition to the double bond in bothand CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_2CH = CH_2, but not in CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_2CH_2CH_3. To distinguish between unsaturated compounds, use an ozonolysis reaction. When you add ozone to a double bond it cleaves so that carbonyl compounds are formed, i.e., compounds of the form where R is H and/or carbon group's, likewise with R . If you perform this reaction on 1-hexene, you obtain CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_2CHO (pentanal) and form-aldehyde (CH_2O), the latter is a gas recognizable by its odor, while the reaction on cyclohexene yields only OCHCH_2CH_2CH_2CH_2CHO (hexanedial).", "images": ["images/E21-0761_files/image002.jpg", "images/E21-0761_files/image004.jpg", "images/E21-0761_files/image006.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E21-0761.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Use reactions that clearly distinguish between functional groups.

{"question": "A 500-kg ore bucket is raised and lowered in a vertical mine shaft using a cable. Determine the upward force exerted by the cable when (a) the upward acceleration is 4 m/s^2 and (b) the bucket is moving upward with a constant velocity.", "solution": "(a) The known quantities are the mass of the ore bucket, m = 5 \u00d7 10^2 kg, and the acceleration, a = 4 m/s^2. The two forces acting on the bucket are the weight and the tension of the cable, as illustrated in the figure. To accelerate the bucket upward, the tension, f, must be larger than the weight of the bucket. This is a consequence of Newton's first law. Newton's first law states that an ob-ject will maintain a constant velocity (or remain at rest) when no net force acts on the object. If the object accelerates, a net force must be acting on it. By vector addi-tion, the resultant upward force, F, is equal to f + w, where w = mg. Since f and w are oppositely directed, the magnitude of their vector sum is equal to the difference of their magnitudes. F = f - w.

This factor can also be called the molecularity of the reaction. To see which particles directly determine the reaction rate, note the effect on the rate when more of a certain type of particle is added. You are told that when KCNO is added, that is, the KCNO concentration is doubled, the rate doubles. This means the reaction must be first order with respect to CNO^- (since, in solution, KCNO dissociates to CNO^-) . When [NH_4Cl] is doubled, the reaction rate is again doubled. Thus, the re-action is first order with respect to NH_4^+ , since, in solution, NH_4Cl dissociates into NH_4^+. Since doubling the amount of either NH_4^+or CNO^- doubles the reaction rate, the he reaction must be second-order overall. (b)By definition, a second order reaction with two different molecules has rate = {-d[A]} /dt = {-d[B]}/dt = k[A][B], where k = rate constant and A and B are the two different molecules in A + B \\rightarrow products. Thus, for this reaction, the rate law becomes rate = {-d [NH_4 CNO]} / [dt] = {d[NH_2]_2co} / (dt) = k[NH_4^+ ][CNO^-] (c)To answer this part, notice the following: The equilibrium constant for the formation of NH_3 and HCNO is extremely small, which means that, in solution, the con-centration of these species in pure NH_4CNO solution should also be small, i.e., [NH_3] / [NH_4^+] = [HCNO] / [CNO^-] = (10^-4)^1/2 = .01. If either NH_3 or HCNO is added to the solution, the reaction is driven to the left.

{"question": "Two long-winged flies were mated. The offspring consisted of 77 with long wings and 24 with short wings. Is the short- winged condition dominant or recessive?What are the genotypes of the parents?", "solution": "When we are not told which of the charac-teristics is dominant and which is recessive, we can deduce it from the ratio of phenotypes in the progeny. We know that 77 flies have long wings and 24 have short wings. This gives us an approximate ratio of 3 long-winged flies to every 1 short- winged fly (77)/(24) \\sim (3/1) As previously noted, the three-to-one ratio signifies that dominant and recessive characteristics are most likely involved. Moreover, because there are three long-winged flies to every short-winged one, it suggests that short-winged is the recessive characteristic, and long-winged is dominant. We cannot immediately conclude that both the long--winged parents are homozygous. In fact they are not, because if they were, no short-winged offspring could have resulted in the cross. So the presence of short-winged flies (homozygous recessive) in the progeny suggests that both parents carry the recessive gene and are thus heterozygotes. Let L be the gene for long wings in flies and l be the gene for short wings in flies. In the cross between two long-winged heterozygous parents: F_11 LL:2 Ll:1 ll long wingshort wing The phenotypes of the F_1 show the three-to-one ratio of long-winged flies to short-winged flies, which concurs with the data given.

{"question": "High levels of progesterone are essential for the maintenance of the uterine lining during pregnancy. But high levels of progesterone exerts a negative feedback action on LH secretion, with a consequent decrease in LH secretion and eventual atrophy of the corpus luteum. Atrophy of the corpus luteum cuts the progesterone supply resulting in menstruation. Clearly, these events cannot take place after conception, or the embryo would get sloughed off. When conception occurs, the corpus luteum is seen to last through most of pregnancy. How can this be explained?", "solution": "It has been shown that the portion of the placenta called the chorion secretes a hormone, called chorionic gonadotrophin, that is functionally very similar to LH. The function of this hormone is to take the place of LH in preserving the corpus luteum, LH production being inhibited by a high progesterone level. The corpus luteum is then able to secrete progesterone at high levels without being shut off. The amount of this chorionic hormone produced in a pregnant woman is very great. A pregnant woman produces so much of this hormone that most of it is excreted in the urine. Many commonly used tests for pregnancy are based on this fact. One test involves the injection of the patient's urine into a test animal such as a rabbit. If chorionic hormone is in the urine, development of a corpus luteum within 24 hours will take place in the rabbit, and pregnancy can be confirmed. Although the corpus luteum is essential during early pregnancy and is present during most of pregnancy, it has been shown that it is no longer necessary after about the first two months. It seems that the placenta begins to secrete progesterone (and estrogen) early in pregnancy, and once this secretion has reached a sufficiently high level the placenta itself can maintain the pregnancy in the absence of the corpus luteum.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F21-0562.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The chorion secretes a hormone, called chorionic gonadotrophin, that is functionally very similar to LH.

{"question": "A solution of hydrogen peroxide is 30% by weight H_2O_2. Assuming a density of 1.11 g/cm^3 and a dissociation constant of 1.0 \u00d7 10^-12 for H_2O_2, what is the pH of the solution?", "solution": "To obtain the pH of any solution, calculate [H^+], since pH = - log [H^+]. To find [H^+], write a balanced chemical equation that expresses the reaction, and from this, set up a dissociation constant expression. Begin by writing the reaction. H_2O_2 \\rightleftarrows H^+ + HO_2^-. The dissociation constant for this reaction, K, equals 1.0 \u00d7 10^-12. K also = {[H^+] [HO_2^-]} / [H_2O_2]. Equating, one obtains {[H^+] [HO_2^-]} / [H_2O_2] = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-12. Solving this expression for [H^+], one obtains thepH.To do that it is necessary to know [H_2O_2]. Given the density, one can assume a volume of 1 liter solution. This means that the mass of the solution is 1.11 g/cm^3 \u00d7 1000 ml (or 1 liter) = 1110 g/l. However, the percent by weight of H_2O_2 is 30%. Therefore, there is only 0.30 1110 g/l of H_2O_2 or 333 g/l. The molecular weight of H_2O_2 is 34 g/mole. Themolarityof the H_2O_2 solution is, then, (333 g/liter) / (34 g/mole) = 9.79 M H_2O_2, sincemolarityequals moles per liter. If one lets x = [H^+], then [H_2O_2] = 9.79 - x, since, at equilibrium, the original amount of H_2O_2 must be decreased by the amount of H^+ (or O_2H^-) formed. The equation, H_2O_2 \\rightleftarrows H^+ + HO_2^- indicates that H^+ will be formed in equal mole amounts with HO_2^-. Thus, [HO_2^-] can equal x.

{"question": "Using the pedigree below, fill in the genotype of each individual.

Consider P_1 (that is, the first member of the Parental generation). Since she expresses the trait, her genotype is aa. To determine the genotype of P_2 , we look at the progeny, F_1 (first generation). From the diagram, we see that F_1,2 is left- handed; hence his genetic make-up is aa. This means that he must have received a copy of a from each of his parents. Therefore we know that P_2 carries a copy of the recessive gene. But since P_2 is phenotypically normal, his genotype must be Aa. F_1,1 and F_1,3 are right-handed. Yet they must have received an a allele from P, since she has only a alleles to transmit. Therefore their genotype of F_1,1 and F_1,3 is Aa. Consider the cross between P_3 and P_4. We know P_3 is aa (because he is left-handed) and P_4, can be AA or Aa (since she is left handed). Since all the offspring are right-handed, it seems probable that P_4 is AA; however, we cannot be entirely certain of this, since both genotypes AA and A_2 are compatible with the phenotypes of the offspring. We know, however, that F_1,4, F_1,5, and F_1,6 must all have the genotype Aa since they carry an a allele donated by P_3.

There are three functions used in this program, which are defined in the beginning of the program. Their procedures are given right after the comment numbered 5. The first card of the input data for this program must contain the number of strings to be sorted, otherwise the program stalls. The part of the program between the comments numbered 1 and 2 reads that number, assigns it to N, and sets up an array of N members. The next program segment (between comments 2 and 3) fills the array with the input items. Notice that counter I is not initialized to zero, because in SNOBOL IV the initial value of the variables is a null string. The statement between the comments 3 and 4 calls and executes the SORT function. Since the entry point label is omitted in the DEFINE statement, the computer looks for the statement labeled SORT, as the initial statement of the function procedure, and finds it right after the comment 5. The function LGT(X, Y), included in the second statement of the SORT function procedure, compares lexically strings X and Y, and succeeds if X follows Y alphabetically. Thus, LGT (SPACE, BLANK) will succeed, while LGT (CAT, DOG) will fail. The next two statements of the SORT function procedure call and execute functions SWITCH and BUBBLE. Function SWITCH makes the two strings switch their places, while the BUBBLE function compares the string with the preceding one and switches them around, if needed, continuously, until the first string is finally properly placed. Thus, the major function SORT works as follows: The first statement (I = LT(I,N-1) I + 1) checks if a currently considered string is numbered 1 through N-1 (there is no need to specially consider the last string N, because, when the string N-1 is considered, it is compared with the string numbered N). The next statement checks the alphabetical order of that string and the one following it in the array. If the order is correct, the next string is considered. If the order is wrong, the fol-lowing string moves up one place, is compared with the next string, moves up again, if needed, and so on, until it is properly placed. When all the input items are considered, the program execution returns to the main part, i.e., to the section between comments 4 and 5 and one by one prints all the input strings in a just arranged alphabetical order.

This unit is used because curies are measured in disintegrations per second. t(1/2)= 8.3 hr \u00d7 60 min/hr \u00d7 60 sec/min = 29880 sec (2) Solving for the number of disintegrations of ^210At in 1 curie. Let x = the total number of nuclei of ^210At in 1 curie, x/2 the number of nuclei left after 1 half-life, 29880 sec. The following ratio can be set up: [(^210At) number of nuclei after 1 half life] / [half-life] = 3.7 \u00d7 10^10dis/sec. One can solve this ratio for x, the original number of nuclei present. [(x/2) / 29880 sec] = 3.7 x lo10dis/sec [x/2] = 29880 sec \u00d7 3.7 \u00d7 10^10dis/sec x = 2 \u00d7 29880 sec \u00d7 3.7 \u00d7 10^10dis/sec = 2.21 \u00d7 10^15 dis. Thus, 2.21 \u00d7 10^15disof ^210At are equal to 1 curie. (3) Solving for the number of moles. There are 6.02 \u00d7 10^23 nuclei per mole. Therefore, the number of moles present is equal to the number of disintegrations divided by 6.02 \u00d7 10^23 . no. of moles= [(2.21 \u00d7 10^15 nuclei) / (6.02 \u00d7 10^23 nuclei / mole) = 3.67 \u00d710^-9 moles (4) One solves for the number of grams necessary by multiplying the number of moles by the molecular weight of ^210At (MW = 210) no. of grams= 210 g/mole \u00d7 3.67 \u00d7 10^-9 moles = 7.71 \u00d7 10^-7 g.

If 1 g of metal is reacted with 5 g of non-metal, find the amount of product produced.", "solution": "To answer this problem, write out the reaction between the metal and non-metal, so that the relative number of moles that react can be determined. You can calculate the number of grams of material that react or are produced. You are told that 1 atom of metal reacts with 2 atoms of non-metal. Let X = non-metal and M = metal. The compound is MX_2. The reaction is M \\rightarrow 2X + MX_2. Determine the number of moles that react. You have 33 g of M with an atomic weight of 24. Therefore, the number of moles = [(33 g) / (24 g/mole) = 1.375 moles. The above reaction states that for every 1 mole of M, 2molesof X must be present. This means, therefore, that 2 \u00d7 1.375 = 2.75 moles of X must be present. The non-metal has an atomic weight of 80. Thus, recalling the definition a mole, 2.75 mole = [(grams) / (80 g/mole)]. Solving for grams of X, you obtain 2.75 (80) = 220 grams. Let us consider the reaction with 1 g of M with 5 g of X to produce an unknown amount of MX_2. The solution is similar to the other, except that here you consider the concept of a limiting reagent. The amount of MX_2 produced from a combination will depend on the substance that exists in the smallest quantity. Thus, to solve this problem you compute the number of moles of M and X present. The smaller number, (based on reaction equation) is the one you employ in calculating the number of moles of MX_2 that will be generated. You have, therefore, M_moles = (1/24) = .04166 moles M X_moles= (5/80) =.0625 moles X. Using 0.0625 moles X, only .03125molesof MX_2 will be produced, since the equation informs you that 1 mole of MX_2 is produced for every two moles of X. For M, it is a 1 : 1 ratio, so that .04166 moles of MX_2 would be generated. Therefore, X is the limiting reagent. The atomic weight of MX_2 is 184.

{"question": "Distinguish between active and passive immunity. How are they produced? Are vaccines andtoxoidsused to induce active immunity or passive immunity?", "solution": "Immunity is a natural or acquired resistance to a specific disease. A host is immune to a certain pathogen as long as the antibodies specific for the pathogen are present in his circulatory system. The crucial difference between active and passive immunity lies in the answer to the host's question, \"Are these anti-bodies made by me or were they formed in some other organism?\" Active immunity results when antibodies are produced by the cells (lymphocytes) of the host as a result of contact with an antigen. The antigen may be a microorganism or its product. Active immunity usually develops slowly within a couple of weeks (as antibody production reaches a maximum level), yet it may last up to many years for some antigens. Active immunity may be induced naturally, while recovering from an infectious disease such as mumps, measles, or chicken pox; or artificially, by vaccines. Vaccines are inactivated or attenuated microorganisms which can still stimulate antibody production. Attenuated microorganisms are living, yet too weak to be virulent. Vaccines are available for typhoid fever, poliomyelitis, rabies, smallpox and various other diseases. Also used to induce active immunity aretoxoids, made by destroying thepoisonous poisonous parts of the toxins produced by some pathogens. The antigenic part of the The antigenic part of the toxin is not affected and can still induce antibody production for protection against diphtheria, tetanus and other diseases. Passive immunity is conferred when antibodies produced by active immunity in one organism are transferred to another. Since no antigen is introduced, there is no stimulation of antibody production; hence, passive immunity is of short duration. It does provide immediate protection, unlike active immunity which requires time for development. Passive immunity is also conferred by both natural or arti-ficial means: naturally, by antibody transfer to the fetus from an immune mother (that is, by placental transfer), or artificially, by injection of serum containing antibodies from an immune individual to a susceptible one. In the latter case, it is not necessary that the donor and the recipient be of the same species. It is, however, dangerous for people who are allergic to animal serum, and so must be used with caution. If the answer to the host's question is \"These are my own antibodies,\" then active immunity is involved; if the answer is \"These are not my antibodies,\" then passive immunity is involved.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F14-0363.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Active immunity results when antibodies are produced by the host's cells as a result of contact with an antigen and can be induced naturally or artificially by vaccines and toxoids.

{"question": "Describe between an exoskeleton and an endoskeleton.", "solution": "In most of the largemulticellularanimals, some kind of skeleton is found that serves for protection, support and locomotion. The skeleton of an animal may be located outside or inside the body. If the former is the case , the skeleton is termed an exoskeleton, and is usually composed of a semiflexible substance known as chitin. If the latter is the case, the skeleton is termed an endoskeleton, and is composed of either carti-lage bone , or both. The hard shells of lobsters, crabs, oysters,clanis, and snails are examples of exoskeletons. In fact, themolluscand arthropod phylums are charac-terized by the presence of an exoskeleton. The advantage of an exoskeleton as a protective device is obvious, but a serious disadvantage is the attendant difficulty of growth. Snails and clams solve this difficulty by secret-ing additions to their shells as they grow. Lobsters and crabs have evolved a complicated process, called molting, whereby the outer shell is first softened by the removal of some of its salts . A new similarly soft cuticle is secreted beneath the old shell. The old shell is then split down the back. Following this split, the animal crawls out of the old shell, grows rapidly for a short time, and thenredepositsthe removed mineral salts in the new shell, hardening it.

Hence, 2200 kg ofAerozine50 contains moles N_2 H_4 = 1.1 \u00d7 10^6 g/32.0 g/mole = 3.4 \u00d7 10^4 moles N_2 H_4 moles (CH_3)_2 N_2 H_2 = 1.1 \u00d7 10^6 g/60.0 g/mole = 1.8 \u00d7 10^4 moles (CH_3)_2 N_2 H_2. 3.4 \u00d7 10^4 moles of N_2 H_4 produces 2 \u00d7 3.4 \u00d7 10^4 = 6.8 \u00d7 10^4 moles of H_2 O and 1.8 \u00d7 10^4 moles of (CH_3)_2 N_2 H_2 produces 4 \u00d7 1.8 \u00d7 10^4 = 7.2 \u00d7 10^4 moles of H_2 O. The total number of moles of H_2 O produced is 6.8 \u00d7 10^4 + 7.2 \u00d7 10^4 = 1.4 \u00d7 10^5 moles. To convert this to mass, we multiply by the molecular weight of water. Hence, 1.4 \u00d7 10^5 moles \u00d7 18.0 g/mole = 2.5 \u00d7 10^6 g = 2.5 \u00d7 10^3 kg of water were produced.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E05-0184.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "2.5 \u00d7 10^3 kg of water"}

Geometric isomerism is one type of stereoisomerism; that is, isomerism due to the arrangement of atoms in a molecule in three dimensions. Geometric isomers are different compounds with different properties. Since the order of attachment of the atoms is the same, they are not structural isomers. The isomer that has the two groups on the same side of the double bond is called the cis isomer and the isomer that has the two groups on the opposite sides is called the trans isomer.

{"question": "Write a FORTRAN program that generates the prime numbers in the 1-2000 interval, using an ancient method known as the SIEVE of ERATOSTHENES.", "solution": "A prime is a number which has only 2 divisors: 1 and itself. There is an ancient method for finding the primes from 2 (the smallest prime) to some number N, called the SIEVE of ERATOSTHENES. This method works as follows: First, the integers from 2 to N are written down. Then, the multiples of the smal-lest available integer, 2, greater than this integer, are crossed out. This step, obviously, eliminates all the even numbers except 2. The procedure is then repeated for the next smallest available integer-3, and then next - 5, because 4 is not available, since it was eliminated during the first step, and so on... Thus, the initial list is scanned repeatedly, and the appropriate integers are crossed off, until the next least remaining integer considered is greater than \\surdN. At this point, all the remaining integers are indeed all the primes between 2 and N. The program is created based upon the above discussion. First, an array of integers from 2 to 2000 is generated. Next, this array is scanned repeatedly, deleting the appropriate integers by replacing them with zeros. At the point when the considered integer is greater than \\surd2000 , all the nonzero elements of the array are placed left justified within the array and then printed.

When an earthworm is cut into several parts, severing its nerve cord in the process, each part will go on crawling around for some time. How can each fragment carry out crawling movement even after the nerve cord is severed?", "solution": "The arrangement of the nervous system in lower invertebrates is quite different from that in higher vertebrates like man. In higher vertebrates, there is an expanded and highly developed anterior end of the spinal cord, forming the brain. The brain coordinates and regu-lates the activities of the entire body. When the brain is separated from the rest of the body, the animal cannot perform any complicated functions. However, in the earthworm, a higher invertebrate, coordinated activities such as crawling can still be ob-served when the body is cut into several transverse sections. This movement is possible because the earth-worm has more than one neural center controlling and coordinating its activities. The nervous system of the earthworm consists of a large, two-lobed aggregation of nerve cells, called the brain, located just above the pharynx in the third segment, and asubpharyngealganglion just below thepharnyxin the fourth segment. A nerve cord connects the brain to the subpharyngeal ganglion and extends from the anterior to the posterior end of the body. In each segment of the body there is a swelling of the nerve cord, called a segmental ganglion. Sensory and motor nerves arise from each segmental ganglion to supply the muscles and organs of that segment. The segmental ganglia coordinate the contraction of the longitudinal and circular muscles of the body wall, so that the worm is able to crawl.

Types of epithelial tissue A. squamous epitheliumB. cuboidal epithelium C. columnar epitheliumD. ciliated columnar epithelium E. sensory epitheliumF. glandular epithelium The surface of the epithelial cell that is exposed to air or fluid often becomes specialized. This surface commonly bears cilia, hairs or fingerlike processes. It may also be covered with waxy or mucous secretions. The opposite surface rests upon other cell layers. Epithelial cells are generally grouped into four categories according to their shape and function: squamous, cuboidal, columnar, and glandular epithelial cells. Squamous cells are much broader than they are thick and have the appearance of thin, flat plates. They are found on the surface of the skin and the lining of the mouth, esophagus and vagina. Cuboidal epithelium (cube-shaped cells) is found in kidney tubules. The cells of columnar epithelium are long and thin, resembling pillars or columns. The stomach and intestines are lined with columnar eoithelium. Some columnar cells have cilia on their surfaces. The function of the cilia is to move sub-stances past the cell. The respiratory tact is character-ized by ciliated columnar epithelium. Finally, a gland may consist of one or many epithelical cells. Exocrine glands have ducts, while endocrine glands do not.

{"question": "As you know 9 bits can address 512 words. Show how on a PDP-8 machine with 4096_10 words in memory, any word can be addressed using 9 bits (extend the memory addressing capa-bilities) .", "solution": "When there were 512_10 words in memory, 9 bits were required to address any word location in the memory. Hence the Instruction Counter register (IC) and Memory Address Register (MAR) were to store 9 bits. The word length we want is 12 bits long therefore, the Memory Buffer Register (MBR) is 12 bits long. The scheme was as follows: When a word had an instruction in it, the first three bits specified operation code and the remaining 9 bits were sufficient. Now as there are 4096 words IC and MAR have to be of 12 bits. The MBR is of 12 bits as word length is 12 bits. Direct addressing of any word in the 4096 words will use a total 12 bits of word and no room (bits) is left for the OP-CODE. The scheme to extend the memory addressing capabilitiesis that is that the 4096_10 words memory is divided into pages. Each page has 128_10 (200_8) words. This is a logical division and not a physical division of memory as shown in Fig. 1. As each page has 128_10 words, 7 bits can address any word on the same page, but as there are 32 pages we need 5 bits to address a page. 5 bits for page + 7 bits for words on page = 12 bits and we end up still with the same problem of having only a total of 12 bits where the first 3 bits are for the OP-CODE and only 9 bits for address. To solve this, two bits, bit 3 and bit 4 are used as I bit and P bit respectively - as illustrated in Fig. 2 When the P bit is 1, the word is on the current page, where the instruction was, and the next address is found by concatenating the 7 address bits and the first five bits of the instruction counter. For example, if we are on page 2 with the IC pointing to 0410_8, the instruction at this location is 1352: 1352 = 001011101010. The first three bits 001 specify the ADD instruction to the accumulator ; the address of the operand is found by observing bits. Bit 4 = 1 i.e. P bit is 1, hence the operand is on the current page and its address is: first 5 bits IC concatenate 7 bits of address 0410_8 = 000100001000 Address = 000101101010 = 0552_8 and 552_8 is the word which is on page 2. If P bit = 0, the page referred is always Page 0 and the address is formed by 5 zeros followed by a 7 bit address in MBR. As an example, assume we are in page 2 with IC point-ing to 0410_8. Now suppose the instruction at this location was 1152_8 i.e. 1152_8 = 001001101010. Since P bit = 0, it references page 0, the OP-CODE 001 part specifies the ADD instruction and the address of the operand is 000001101010 = 0152_8 where this a word on page 0. By doing the above we have extended our addressing capabilities to address 256_10 words, 128 word on page 0 + 128 words on any current page. Yet the memory has 4096 words. A mechanism to address from one page to another is established using bit 3 as an indirect bit. When I = 0 it is Direct address and the address is ob-tained, depending on the P bit and the 7-address bits. When I = 1 it is Indirect address, i.e. the address specified by the address bit is not the address of the op-erand but the contents of the given address (location) are the address of the operand. For example, suppose data 25_10 is stored in location 100_10 and 100_10 is stored at 15_10. Then indirect addressing will be ADD I15 I being present, data at location 15 i.e. 100 is not to be added to accumulator; rather, the data of 100 has to be used as an address. At this address data = 25 is stored; this is to be added to accumulator. Now in the PDP-8 when I bit = 1 there are two condi-tions of the P bit. If I = 1, P = 0 then the page is zero page. On page zero, go to the location specified by 7 - address bits. The contents of this location, a 12 bit word, is the address of the operand. If I = 1, P = 1 then the page is the current page as given by instruction counter IC. Suppose we are on page 2 where the IC is pointing to 0410_8 brought in the MBR instruction1752_8, 1752_8 = 001111101010 OP-CODE = 001 is the ADD instruction. I bit = 1, P bit = 1 As in indirect addressing, the location specified by address bits has the address of the operand we need to find the lo-cation specified. As P = 1 the address of the location = first 5 bits of IC concatenated with 7 address bits = 000101101010 = 0552_8. Now location 0552_8 has the full 12 bit address of operand. These 12 bits can be the location of any of the 4096 words in memory. Thus by using the concept of I bit and P bit the addressing capability of memory is increased.", "images": ["images/G09-0216_files/image002.jpg", "images/G09-0216_files/image004.jpg", "images/G09-0216_files/image006.jpg", "images/G09-0216_files/image008.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G09-0216.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The addressing capability of memory is increased by using the concept of I bit and P bit."}

{"question": "Describe the functional units of a typical computer system hardware.", "solution": "The computer hardware typically consists of functional units shown in Figure 1-3. Take as an example the lower end of the various types of computer systems (see next problem), such as Apple Mac IIx, IBM PS/2 80, and Next Inc. NeXT systems. In such systems, the input device is typically a monitor (a console terminal usually ca-pable of graphics) and optionally another CRT terminal. Strictly speaking, these devices are used for both input and output, where the keyboard is used for input and the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) screen is used for output. In the example, typically the keyboard is type PC with a number of functions keys for the monitor used as the main system console. Additional terminals that are attached to the RS-232C serial ports of the personal computer may be of plain ASCII type capable of displaying only characters or graphics type capable of low or high resolution graphics. As noted, the user's screen is the output device. The output device may also be a printer attached to either parallel ports (Centronix type with 36 pins) or serial ports (RS-232C type with 25 pins) . The printer normally prints on a standard 8.5 \u00d7 11 paper with number of characters per line de-termined by the letter font used. The printers may be of letter- quality or dot-matrix type. The former normally uses daisy-chain character fonts and ribbons much like the typewriters. The dot--matrix printers define characters on a matrix of dots (normally, 5- by-7 or 9-by-12). These, in turn, may be of ribbon or ink-jet types. The ribbon types imprint the pattern through a ribbon, whereas ink-jet types eject special ink through the pattern. Finally, there are laser printers that utilize toners (ink pow-ders) and laser technology to produce high quality print indis-tinguishable from letter quality. The dot-matrix printers are capable of picture output in graphics mode. The communication device is generally a modem that converts signals back and forth for transmission over public telephone lines. The modem may be built-in (e.g. an electronic card inside the PC) or external such as Hayes smartmodem series. The disk may consist of one or two diskette drivers capable of processing 4.5-inch diskettes with capacities of 340 kilo-bytes or 1.2 megabytes. There may also be an optional internal Hard Disk Unit (HDU) with capacities anywhere from 10 to 300 megabytes. In the case of the more modern NeXT personal com-puter, an optical (rather than magnetic) disk unit with 500 megabyte capacity is used, along with an optional magnetic car-tridge tape unit, is used. Note that, in a way analogous to the purchase of automobiles, the computers come with standard (e.g. bundled with basic price) features and accessories, and also optional features and accessories (at additional cost!). The primary memory is Random Access Memory (RAM) that can be read or written. There may, in addition, be ROM memories that contain read-only code to be executed. Such memories may contain frequently used input-output or communication software that is burned (stored permanently) into the ROM. As we move from personal to the more sophisticated computer systems that can support many users, the picture is more complex in terms of a bewildering variety of input, output, and communi-cation devices. For example, in the case of mainframe computers, there may be I/O channels, multiplexers, concentrators, etc. as well as a hierarchy of memories from fast cache memories to slow mass storage units.", "images": ["images/G01-0010_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G01-0010.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The computer hardware typically consists of functional units such as input devices (like a monitor and keyboard), output devices (like a CRT screen and printer), communication devices (like a modem), disk units, and memory units (like RAM and ROM)."}

{"question": "What is the maximum speed at which a car can safely round a circular curve of radius 160 ft on a horizontal road if the coefficient of static friction between tires and road is 0.8? The width between the wheels is 5 ft and the center of gravity of the car is 2 ft above the road. Will the car overturn or skid if it just exceeds this speed?", "solution": "The magnitude of the maximum frictional force that can be brought into play between tires and road is F = \\muN, where N^\\ding{217} is the normal force exerted by the road on the car and \\mu is the coefficient of static friction. But, since there is no upward movement of the car, N^\\ding{217} just balances the third force acting on the car, the weight mg^\\ding{217}. Hence F = \\mumg. This must provide the centripetal force necessary to keep the car in the curve of radius r when it is moving with the maximum permissible speed v. Hence, \\mumg = mv^2/r v = \\surd(\\murg) = \\surd(0.8 \u00d7 160 ft \u00d7 32 ft \\bullet s^-2) v = 65 ft \\bullet s^-1. The frictional force F^\\ding{217} acts in the plane of the road surface and not through the center of mass of the car. In addition to providing the centripetal force necessary to keep the car in the curve, the frictional force must therefore produce a rotational motion about the center of mass. The only point of contact between car and road will then be at O in the diagram. Therefore, N^\\ding{217} must act through this point; but the weight of the car of magnitude mg = N still acts through the center of gravity. These two parallel but displaced forces form a couple of positive moment, tending to restore all car wheels to the road and to prevent the overturning. The moment of the frictional force is -\\muN = - mv^2/r multiplied by the height of the center of mass above the road. Thus M_1 = -\\muN \u00d7 2 ft = -\\mumg \u00d7 2 ft. Assuming that the center of gravity of the car is centrally located, the moment of normal force is N = mg, multiplied by half the width between the wheels.

The restoring moment is therefore greater than the overturning moment at the maximum speed. If this speed is just exceeded, the car does not overturn. It skids, since the centripetal force is not now great enough to provide the acceleration necessary to keep it going round the curve, and the overturning moment is less than the restoring moment.", "images": ["images/D04-0168_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Physics/D04-0168.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "65 ft s^-1"}

The gas is one part is raised in temperature to 100\\textdegreeC; the other volume is maintained at the original temperature. The piston and walls are perfect insulators. How far will the piston move during the change in temperature?", "solution": "The heating of one side of the cylinder increases the pressure of the gas in that portion. If the piston were fixed, the volumes on the two sides would stay equal and there would be a pressure difference across the piston. Since the piston is movable, it alters its position until there is no pressure difference between its two sides: the hotter gas expands and thus drops in pressure, and the cooler gas is compressed and thus increases in pressure. When equilibrium has been reached, the two pressures are equal at p_0; the cooler gas now occupies a volume smaller by an amountdVand the hotter gas a volume greater by a corresponding amountdV. The ideal gas equations for both compartments are p_0(V -dV) =nRT(1) p_0(V +dV) =nRT' where n is the number of moles in each compartment, T and T are the temperatures.

{"question": "When ultraviolet light of frequency 1.3 \u00d7 10^15 sec^-1 is shined on a metal, photoelectrons are ejected with a maximum energy of 1.8 electron volts. Calculate the work function of the metal in ergs and electron volts. What is the threshold frequency of this metal?", "solution": "This problem is an example of the photo- electric effect. We want to relate the work function of a metal to the energy of the incident radiation. (The work function is the amount of energy needed to release an electron from the attraction of the rest of the metal, and thereby pull it out of the metal.) Let us examine the reaction occurring. A photon of energyhu(the ultraviolet radiation) collides with an electron of the metal, and, in the process, gives up all of its energy. Ifhuis large enough, the electron will travel through the metal and be released with kinetic energy (1/2) mv^2, where m and v are the electron mass and velocity, respectively. In leaving the metal, the electron loses energy due to collisions with atoms of the metal. The electron also loses energy, equal in amount to the work function, in order to overcome the attraction of the metal and escape. If we examine only those electrons which lie close to the surface of the metal, we observe that they do not go through any collisions and hence can-not lose energy by this means. These surface electrons lose less energy than the interior electrons and there-fore will have a maximum amount of kinetic energy when they leave the metal. Using the principle of conservation of energy, we obtain hu= (1/2) m v^2_max + \\textphi(1) where \\textphi is the work function of the metal. (Note that this relation is true only for surface electrons.) Solving (1) for \\textphi, we obtain \\textphi =hu- (1/2) mv^2_max(2) The energy of a photon of the ultraviolet light is hu= 6.625 \u00d7 10^-27 \u00d7 1.3 \u00d7 10^15 erg = 8.61 \u00d7 10^-12 erg Since 1 electron volt = 1.60 \u00d7 10^-12 erg, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons is (1/2) mv^2_max = 1.8 X 1.6 X 10^-12 erg = 2.88 X 10^-12 erg From equation 2, the work function is \\textphi =hu- (1/2) mv^2_max = 8.61 X 10^-12 - 2.88 X 10^-12 erg = 5.73 X 10^-12 erg Since 1 erg = .625 \u00d7 10^12eV \\textphi = (5.73 \u00d7 10^-12 erg) [.625 \u00d7 10^12 (eV/erg)] \\textphi = 3.58eV The threshold frequency is the smallest frequency of indecent radiation for which the electrons will be released from the metal with no kinetic energy.

Among the flatworms the flukes are parasitic. Describe the body structure of a fluke, its modifica-tions for a parasitic existence, and its life cycle.", "solution": "The adult fluke is roughly one inch long, and its body is quite flat. The worm is covered by a cuticle that is secreted by the underlying cells. The cuticle is one of its adaptation for parasitism, for it protects the worm from the enzymatic action of the host. With the development of the cuticle, the cilia and sense organs so characteristic of other flatworms have disappeared. The mouth is located at the anterior end and is surrounded by an oral sucker. Another sucker, the ventral sucker, is located some distance posterior to the mouth. The ventral sucker is used to attach the fluke to the body of its victim, the host. The anterior sucker, with the aid of the muscular pharynx, is used to withdraw nutrients from the host. The mouth opens into a muscular pharynx, and just back of this, the alimentary tract branches into two long intestines that extend posteriorly almost the entire length of the body. By far the most complicated aspect of these worms is their reproductive cycle. The fluke is hermaphroditic, that is, it contains both male and female sexual organs. There is no copulatory structure in the flukes and re-production occurs through self fertilization. Following fertilization, the eggs are expelled from the fluke, which at this point is within the host's body; they then exit from the host's body in the feces. Hatching of the eggs in the oriental liver fluke occurs only when the eggs are eaten by certain species of freshwater snails, and takes place in the digestive system of the snail. Here, the egg hatches into a ciliated, free-swimming miracidium (see Figure). Within the digestive system of the snail, which is called the first intermediate host, the miracidium develops into a second larval stage, called a sporocyst. Inside the hollow sporocyst, germinal cells give rise to a number of embryonic masses. Each mass develops into another larval stage called a redia, or daughter sporocyst. Germinal cells within the redia again develop into a number of larvae called cercariae. The cercaria possesses a digestive tract, suckers and a tail. The cercaria is free swimming and leaves the snail. If it comes in contact with a second intermediate host, an invertebrate or a vertebrate, it penetrates the host and encysts. The encysted stage is called a metacercaria. If the host of the metacercaria is eaten by the final vertebrate host, the metacercaria is released, migrates, and develops into the adult form within a characteristic location in the host, usually the bile passages of the liver. Man, the final host, usually gets the fluke by eating a fish which contains the en-cysted cercaria.", "images": ["images/F11-0286_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F11-0286.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The adult fluke is roughly one inch long, flat, covered by a cuticle, has an anterior mouth surrounded by an oral sucker and a ventral sucker.

{"question": "Define the term vitamin. Describe the function of each essential vitamin needed by the human body.", "solution": "Vitamins are relatively simple organic com-pounds required in minute quantities and not used as an energy source. Vitamins are required in very small quantities because they serve as coenzymes or as parts of coenzymes. A coenzyme is a substance required by an enzyme for catalytic activity. Since coenzymes, like enzymes, are not altered in a reaction and may be used repeatedly, and for more than one enzyme, only small amounts are needed. There are two principal groups of vitamins: the fat- soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and the water-soluble vitamins (B complex and C). Vitamin A is necessary for the growth and maintenance of the epithelial cells of the skin, various tracts in the body and the eye. It is also a precursor to the visual pigment,retinaldehyde, in the eye. A deficiency of vitamin A results in lowered resistance of skin to infection and in night blindness. Vitamin D can be synthesized by the skin in the presence of ultraviolet light. Vitamin D is required for normal growth of the skeleton and teeth because it controls the levels of calcium and phosphorus in the body. Malforma-tion of the bones, known as rickets, is associated with a lack of vitamin D. Some vitamins needed by man vitamin Some deficiency symptoms Important sources FAT-SOLUBLE Vitamin A (retinol) Dry. brittle epithelia of skin, respiratory system, andurogenitaltract; night blindness and malformed rods Green and yellow vegetables and fruit, dairy products, egg yolk, fish-liver oil Vitamin D (calciferol) Rickets orosteomalacia( very low blood calcium level, soft bones, distorted skeleton, poor muscular development) Egg yolk, milk, fish oils Vitamin E (tocopherol) Male sterility in rats (and perhaps other animals); muscular dystrophy in some animals; abnormal red blood cells in infants; death of rat and chicken embryos Widely distributed in both plant and animal food, e.g. meat, egg yolk, green vegetables, seed oils Vitamin K Slow blood clotting and hemorrhage Green vegetables WATER - SOLUBLE Thiamine (B1) Beriberi (muscle atrophy, paralysis, mental confusion, congestive heart failure) Whole-grain cereals, yeast, nuts, liver, pork Riboflavin (B2) Vascularization of the cornea, conjunctivitis, and disturbances of vision; sores on the lips and tongue; disorders of liver and nerves in experimental animals Milk, cheese, eggs, yeast, liver, wheat germ, leafy vegetables Pyridoxine (B6) Convulsions, dermatitis, impairment of antibody synthesis Whole grains, fresh meat, eggs, liver, fresh vegetables Pantothenic acid Impairment of adrenal cortical function, numbness and pain in toes and feet, impairment of antibody synthesis Present in almost all foods, especially fresh vegetables and meat, whole grains, eggs Biotin Clinical symptoms in man are extremely rare, but can be produced by great excess of raw egg white in diet; symptoms are dermatitis, conjunctivitis Present in many foods, including liver, yeast, fresh vegetables Nicotinamide Pellagra (dermatitis, diarrhea, irritability, abdominal pain, numbness, mental disturbance) Meat, yeast, whole wheat Folic acid Anemia, impairment of antibody synthesis, stunted growth in young animals Leafy vegetables, liver Cobalamin (B12) Pernicious anemia Liver and other meats Ascorbic acid (C) Scurvy (bleeding gums, loose teeth, anemia, painful and swollen joints, delayed healing of wounds, emaciation) Citrus fruits, tomatoes Vitamin E is important in some animals in maintaining good muscle condition and normal liver function. In addi-tion, vitamin E has been shown to be necessary in prevent-ing sterility in many test animals including rats, chickens and ducks. A deficiency of vitamin E produces progressive deterioration and paralysis of the muscles, abnormal red blood cells in infants, and male sterility in some animals. A deficiency of this vitamin rarely occurs in man. Vitamin K plays an important role in the normal co-agulation of blood by promoting synthesis in the liver ofprothrombinandproconvertin. These are two factors of the blood-clotting system. Vitamin K-deficient patients are highly susceptible to hemorrhages. Bacteria living in the large intestine of man are capable of producing vitamin K. Vitamin C, a water-soluble vitamin, is required in cellular metabolism, specifically in cellular reductions. It is also important in the formation ofhydroxyproline, one of the constituents of collagen. The disease scurvy, resulting from a lack of this vitamin, is characterized by bleeding gums, bruised skin, painful swollen joints and general weakness. Vitamin B complex is a group of water-soluble com-pounds, unrelated chemically but which tend to be associ-ated together. Several of them act as parts of coenzymes functioning in cellular respiration. For example, thiamine (vitamin B1) is a principal part of the coenzyme that catalyzes the oxidation ofpyruvicacid. Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is one of the hydrogen-carriers in the oxida-tivecytochromesystem. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is a com-ponent of a coenzyme involved intransamination-reactions transferring amino groups from one compound to another.

{"question": "Using the pedigree below, determine the method of inheritance of the trait, and as far as possible, fill in the genotypes of each individual.", "solution": "One should immediately note that the trait is only exhibited by male members of the family. Although the number of individuals is small enough that this could have been a a chance occurrence, it strongly suggests that the trait is sex-linked. Proceeding on this assumption, we can deduce the possible genotype of each member. Letting r represent the recessive, sex-linked allele, we can assign the genotype X^rY to P_1, F_1,7, F_2,1 ,F_2,3 ,F_2,5 ,and F_3,1, since all are males expressing the trait. Since F_2,7 ,a male, does not express the trait, and there-fore does not carry the r allele, his genotype is X^RY, where R represents the normal allele. We know that F_3,1 must have received the r allele from his mother, F_2,6 since to a male offspring, the mother contributes the X while the father contributes the Y chromosome. The genotype of F_2,6 is then X^RX^r, since she does not express the trait. F_1,5 must also be a carrier (X^RX^r) since F_2,6 is a carrier, F _2,5 expresses the trait, and F1,4,who must be X^RY, could not have donated the recessive allele to his offspring. Since we have no information concerning the offspring of F_2,4 ,her genotype could be either X^RX^R or X^Rx^r, depending on whether she received a dominant or recessive allele from F_1,5 . Since F_1,5 is a carrier, and her father P_3 ,who does not express the trait, is X^RY, we can assign P_4, the geno-type X^RX^r , which shows that she is also a carrier. F_1,6 can be either X^RX^R or X^Rx^r, one dominant allele in either case being necessarily donated by P_3. F_1,3 a male not expressing the trait, is X^RY. Since no male offspring of P_1 and P_2 express the trait, it is likely though not necessary, that P_2 .is not a carrier. Her possible genotypes are X^RX^R and X^Rx^r. F_1,2 must have received the recessive allele from P_1 and be a carrier (X^Rx^r). F_1,1 must be X^RY since he does not express the trait. F_2,2 could be either X^RX^R or X^RX^r. Summarizing, we can see that our assumption of sex linkage is consistent with the inheritance pattern of the trait :", "images": ["images/F26-0688_files/image002.jpg", "images/F26-0688_files/image004.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F26-0688.htm", "image_question": true, "image_answer": true, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The trait is sex-linked."}

{"question": "What is paleontology? List the various kinds ofpaleontologic evidence. Why is it that fossils are frequently difficult to find?", "solution": "Paleontology is the science of the finding, cataloguing and interpretationof the abundant and diverse evidence of life in ancient times. Fossils are the most important tools of the paleontologist in studying the past. Fossils can be bones, shells, teeth, and other hard parts of an animalor plant body which have been preserved, and indeed, include any impressionor trace left by some previous organism. As such they constitutethepaleontologicevidence of evolution. Most of the vertebrate fossils found are skeletal parts. From these partspaleontologists can infer the contours of the body, the posture, and thestyle of walking of the ancient animal. Using this information, recon-structionscan be made showing how the animal may have looked in life. Footprints or trails are another type of fossil. These are made by the animalin soft mud, which subsequently hardened. They enable one to inferthe size, body proportion, structures, and style of walking of the animalthat made them. Tools made by early man are also important artifacts. They aid in the determination of how and whenbipedalism evolved(hands had to be free in order to use tools). The discovery of tools alsoserves as invaluable information, providing clues of early man's culture, and can even be used to infer the origin of language. Petrified fossils result from the replacement by minerals of the originalanimal or plant material. The minerals that replace the once living tissuesmay be iron pyrites: silica, calcium carbonate or a variety of other substances. Petrifaction has been shown to be an effective type of preservationfor tissues as old as 300,000,000 years. Molds are still anothertype of fossil, and are formed by the hardening of the material surroundingthe buried organism, followed by the decay and removal of theorganism by ground water. Sometimes the molds became accidentally filledwith minerals, which then hardened to form casts or replicas of the originalorganism. In the far north, frozen fossils of whole animal bodies have been foundin the ground or ice. Old forms of plants, insects and spiders have beenfound preserved in amber, a fossil resin from pine trees. The resin wasat first a soft sap engulfing the fragile insect; then it slowly hardened, preservingthe insect intact. Usually, then, the formation and preservation of a fossil follows the buryingof some structure or entire organism. This may occur at the bottomof a deep body of water, or on land hidden deep in the earth's crust. Generally, fossils are preserved in areas that are well hidden or hardto reach. This is because fossils under shallow water or near the earth'ssurface are usually destroyed due to constant disturbances from naturalforces, such as wind and rain, and from living organisms.

{"question": "What are the functions of the xylem and the phloem?", "solution": "In vascular plants, the vital function of the transportation of food, water and minerals is performed by the vascular system, composed of the xylem and the phloem. The xylem is chiefly concerned with the conduction of water and mineral salts from the roots to the above-ground portion of the plant, where they are used for photosynthesis and other metabolic purposes. The xylem also serves as a means of support in larger vascular plants. It contains several specialized cell types, the two major kinds being the tracheids and vessel elements. Both are elongated cells with thickened cellulose walls heavily impregnated with lignin; both contain no living protoplasm, and hence are dead cells. The tracheids (see Figure 1) have tapering ends and lateral pores, or pits, which al-low water to flow between adjacent cells. Although structurally similar, vessel elements are a more efficient system for conduction than tracheids. At maturity, the end of the vessels are broken down to form a perforation area, so that each individual cell is continuous with the cell above and the cell below. Vessel cells are thought to have evolved from tracheids, having increasing degrees of perforation with evolutionary advancement, (see Figure 2) Indeed, vessel elements are characteristic of the flowering plants and do not occur at all in most of the less advanced gymnosperms. Vessel elements have lateral pits but movement of materials is chiefly through their ends. Carbohydrates are manufactured primarily in the leaves of a plant. They are transported to the other parts of the plant by the phloem, which runs parallel to the xylem throughout the plant body. The phloem consists of elongated, tube-like cells, called sieve-tube elements, with specialized pores at each end (See Figure 3). Unlike the tracheids and vessels, mature sieve-tube elements are living and have a protoplasm, but no nuclei. The sieve-tube-elements are associated with small, narrow cells having dense contents and prominent nuclei, knowns as the companion cells. These cells probably function as the `nuclei' for the sieve - tube elements and make it possible for them to continue to function. Besides conduction, the phloem serves as a supporting tissue, due to the presence of strong fibers in the walls of its cells.", "images": ["images/F09-0224_files/image002.jpg", "images/F09-0224_files/image004.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F09-0224.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The xylem is chiefly concerned with the conduction of water and mineral salts from the roots to the above-ground portion of the plant.

{"question": "The flashlight battery is a zinc and manganese dioxide (MnO_2) dry cell.

The number of moles of MnO_2 present is [mass, MnO_2] / [molecular weight, MnO_2] = (4.35) / (87g / mole) = 0.05 mole MnO_2 .

{"question": "Describe the events of meiosis and account for its importance .", "solution": "Meiosis is the process of gamete formation in which two cell divisions occur in succession to give rise to four haploid daughter cells with each bearing only one copy of an individual chromosome, unlike the diploid parent cell which carried two copies. The sequence of events in meiosis begins as in mitosis. Chromosomes that have already duplicated in interphase begin to shorten in the first meiotic prophase to form con-densed, easily visible structures; each consists of two identical chromatids joined together at the centromere. It is during this condensation of the chromosomes that the first unique event of meiosis occurs: the synapsis (pairing) of homologous chromosomes, each made up of two chromatids. Each joined pair of homologous chromosomes is known as a tetrad. As the chromatids become more and more condensed, it is possible to see points at which they connect to one another, forming cross-bridges called chiasmata. These may be considered to be the visible manifestations of crossing over between a pair of chroma-tids. Only two of the four chromatids (non-sister chromatids) present in the tetrad can be involved in the formation of a chiasma. The end of the first meiotic prophase is marked by the disappearance of the nuclear membrane and the nucleolus. At the first meiotic metaphase, the homologous pairs (tetrads), having reached maximum condensation, line up along the equator of the meiotic spindle. This is followed by the first meiotic anaphase, during which the chromosomes separate from their homologs without separation of the sister chromatids, which remain attached at the centromere. Gradually, the duplicated chromosomes, now known as dyads, move to the two poles of the meiotic spindle. At telophase, when the chromosomes have reached the two poles, cytoplasmic division occurs. At this point, the chromosomes may become less condensed and enter into a brief, second meiotic interphase, during which the nuclear membrane forms again. The chromosomes grow diffuse but do not replicate. A second prophase follows rapidly, and the chromosomes again condense. There is, however, no synapsis, because the homologous chromosomes had separated at the first meiotic anaphase. The nuclear membrane and the nucleolus now disappear as during the first meiotic division. Those species which do not exhibit a second interphase go directly from the first telophase into a brief second prophase, during which spindle formation occurs. During metaphase, the two members of each dyad line up at the equator. At the second meiotic anaphase, the sister chromatids separate at the centromere, one going to each pole. When they have reached the poles, the nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear. Cytoplasmic cleavage follows, giving rise to distinct daughter cells. After the second meiotic division, the number of chromosomes in each cell is half the original number, and reduction is complete. The process of meiosis began with a single cell (2n) which doubled its chromosomes, resulting in four copies of each type of chromosome (4n). Two meiotic cell divisions then produced four cells (1n) from this one cell. Because there was no chromosome doubling between the two divisions, there is necessarily a halving of the original chromosome number. In any sexual organism, there are two genetic forms, the haploid (1n) and the diploid (2n), which alternate from generation to generation. The diploid generation gives rise to the haploid generation by meiosis, and the haploid generation gives rise to the diploid generation by fertilization, which is the fusion of two haploid cells. Meiosis is thus important in ensuring that, after fertilization, the original diploid state is retained. Another extremely important factor in meiosis is the possibility of getting new combinations of genes as a result not only of crossing over between synapsing chromosomes in the first meiotic division, but also of the random segregation of the homologous chromosomes during the first anaphase. These factors contribute to the genetic variation which forms the basis for natural selection and thus evolution. If the new combination of genes confer some advantage to the organism possessing it, that organism will have a better chance of survival.", "images": ["images/F22-0572_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F22-0572.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Meiosis is the process of gamete formation in which two cell divisions occur in succession to give rise to four haploid daughter cells.

{"question": "Some scientists object to the Darwin-Wallace theory of naturalselection on the basis that it cannot explain the presenceof many apparently useless structures in some organisms. These vestigial structures seem to defy the processesof natural selection which tend to provide successivegenerations with better adaptations to their environment. How can you defend the theory ofnatural selection?", "solution": "While certain structures may be useless to the organism in which theyoccur, they may be present because they are controlled by genes thatare closely linked to other genes controlling characteristics important forsurvival. Such closely linked genes will be inherited together in most cases, and so the vestigial characteristic will tend to be inherited along withthe more important trait. Other vestigial structures may have physiologicaleffects of survival value which are not visible to the observer. They may represent intermediate stages in the evolution of some importantadaptive structure, or be an incidental by-product of an importantbut invisible physiological trait. They may also be present becausethey have become fixed in a population by chance or genetic drift. Genetic drift is important in the evolution of small, isolated populations. Within a small breeding population, heterozygous gene pairs tendto become homozygous for one allele or the other by chance rather thanselection. This may lead to the expression and accumulation of certainphenotypes of no particular adaptive value. If the phenotypes are notlethal, they will remain in the popu-lation. Because natural selection canact only when there is a certain level of variation among the individuals, it loses its significance in a small breeding population. Under thiscondition, chance becomes the important factor in evolution. Thus, the presence of apparently useless traits does not necessarilyinvalidate the theory of natural selection. It should be noted thatnatural selection and the presence of vestigial structures are mutually exclusivephenomena, and therefore, the inheritance of vestigial traits shouldnot be governed by selection processes. Natural selection is definedas the process by which a beneficial trait is selected for, such that moreorganisms possessing the gene for this trait will be present in the population. These are the organisms producing the most offspring, and thuscontributing the most genes to the population's gene pool. Vestigial structuresare defined as those structures which no longer have any biologicalsignificance, neither advantageous, nor deleterious to the organismpossessing them. Since natural selection operates to select for advantageoustraits by eliminating deleterious traits, and vestigial structuresare neither beneficial nor harm-ful, these structures will neither beselected for nor eliminated. However, it should be noted that many vestigialtraits are remnants of what were once important structures. While thegenes for the vestigial traits were not directly selected for, their precursortraits were, and so more individuals than not will tend to possessthe vestigial trait. Its inheritance in future generations, however, willnot be governed by natural selection.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F27-0717.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Vestigial structures may be present because they are controlled by genes that are closely linked to other genes controlling characteristics important for survival or they may represent intermediate stages in the evolution of some important adaptive structure, or be an incidental by-product of an important but invisible physiological trait.

The critical pressure is the pressure necessary to liquefy a gas at its critical temperature. Both temperature and pressure are factors in the condensation of a gas. Molecules of a particular compound have a lower kinetic energy in their liquid state than in their gaseous state. kinetic energy = mass \u00d7 (velocity)^2 Therefore, kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the velocities of the particles. In the gaseous state the velocities of the molecules are greater, when the temperature of a system is decreased the velocities of the molecules decrease and, hence, the kinetic energies decrease. If the pressure of the system is increased, the particles are forced closer together. At a certain point, when the kinetic energy will be low and/or the particles will be close enough together, the gas will liquefy. If a gas has a high critical temperature, less energy is necessary to liquefy it. In the liquid state the molecules are much closer together than in the gas.

The energy of an incident photon is entirely given up to one electron of the metal. If this is an interior electron, it will travel towards the surface of the metal and, in the process, loose energy due to collisions with atoms of the metal. In addition, the electrons will loose energy because they must overcome the attractive force of the atoms of the metal in order to escape from the surface. (The energy needed to overcome this attractive force is called the metal's work function, W). Electrons near the surface of the metal, however, don't experience the collisions de-scribed above, and they can't lose energy due to this cause. As a result, these surface electrons will be emitted with a higher kinetic energy than the interior electrons.

{"question": "It is known that the anti conformation of n-butane is .8Kcal/mole more stable than the Gauche conformation. Explain why.", "solution": "Different arrangements of atoms that can be converted into one another by rotation about single bonds are called conformations. In the anti conformation of n-butane the methyl groups (CH_3) are as far apart as possible. The gauche conformations of n-butane are with the methyl groups only 60\\textdegree apart. This can be seen more clearly by using Newman projections for the conformations of n-butane. See figure A. Notice that in the gauche conformations, the methyl groups are closer together than in the anticonformation. When these groups are close together, as in the gauche conformations, steric hindrance occurs between them. This means that there is not really enough room for these two groups to be so close together. This is due to the fact that around any nuclei there is a certain volume which is taken up by the atoms electrons. This volume is determined by the van der Waal's radii of a particular atom. When atoms are too close to permit this volume, a repulsive force called van der Waals' repulsion occurs. This force acts to create a greater distance between the nucleii. This, then, raises the energy (level and lowers the stability) of the gauche conformation. In the anti conformation, the methyls are much further apart, so that you don't have van der Waal's repulsion, thus the molecule is much more stable.", "images": ["images/E20-0729_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E20-0729.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "In the anti conformation of n-butane the methyl groups are as far apart as possible, avoiding van der Waals' repulsion, thus the molecule is much more stable."}
{"question": "A cylindrical glass tube of length L is half submerged in mercury, as shown in Figure a. The tube is closed by a finger and withdrawn. Part of the mercury flows out. What length of mercury column remains in the tube? (Figs. b and c). Take the atmospheric pressure P_A to be H cm Hg.", "solution": "When the tube is submerged in mercury with both ends open, mercury rises in the tube until the levels of mercury in the tube and in the container are the same (Fig. a). We expect no change in the level of the mercury inside the tube if we close the top of the tube since the air trapped inside was previously in equilibrium with the atmospheric pressure P_a. Closing the top does not change the state of the air inside so that the air pressure on the mercury inside the tube is still P_a (Fig. b). When the tube is in air with its top still closed, the mercury flows out until the pressure at the bottom of the tube equals air pressure (Fig. c). If P is the pressure of the air in the tube and h is the length of the remaining mercury, we can write P_A = P + [(weight of the mercury)/(cross-sectional area)] = P + (W_Hg/A) = P + [(\\rho_Hg A\\bullet h)/A] = P + h\\rho_Hg(1) where \\rho_Hg is is the specific weight of mercury. We can find P by using Boyle's law for the air trapped in the tube. Since the temperature remains constant, we have, (P_a) \u00d7 (Volume in Fig. b) = (P) \u00d7 (Volume in Fig. c) orP_a (1/2)LA = P (L - h)A givingP = [LP_a] / [2(L - H)].(2) Substituting (2) in (1), we get P_a = P_a{L/[2(L - H)]}+ h\\rho_Hg.(3) We are told that P_a is equal to the weight of H cm long mercury column with unit cross-sectional area, P_a = H\\rho_Hg Hence, (3) becomes H\\rho_Hg = H\\rho_Hg{L/[2(L - H)]} + h\\rho_Hg orH = H{L/[2(L - H)]} + h.(4) If we solve (4) for h, we get 2H(L - h) = HL + 2h(L - h) 2HL - 2Hh = HL - 2hL + 2h^2 = 0 2h^2 - 2h(H + L) + LH = 0.

What is the mean distance between molecules (assuming that the container has a cubic shape), and approximately what distance will a molecule travel before it collides with another?", "solution": "The number of moles of gas present is the mass of gas present divided by the molecular mass of nitrogen, or n = (36/28) = 1.29 The pressure is p = 3 atm = 3 \u00d7 1.013 \u00d7 10^5 N/m^2 = 3.04 \u00d7 10^5 N/m^2 Thus the volume of the container is by the ideal gas law V = nRT/p = (1.29 moles \u00d7 8.313 joules/\\textdegreek \u00d7 473\\textdegree k)/(3.04 \u00d7 10^5 N/m^2) = (1.29 moles \u00d7 8.313 N-m/\\textdegreek \u00d7 473\\textdegree k)/(3.04 \u00d710^5 N/m^2) = 16.7 \u00d7 10^-3 m^3 That is, the volume is a cube with sides 25.6 cm. The total number of molecules is the number of moles of gas times Avogadro's number, or (1.29 moles)[6.02 \u00d7 10^23 (molecules/moles)] = 1.29 \u00d7 6.02 \u00d7 10^23 molecules so that the volume per molecule is (16.7 \u00d7 10^-3 m^3)/(1.29 \u00d7 6.02 \u00d7 10^23) = 2.15 \u00d710^-26 m^3 = 2.15 \u00d7 10^-20 cm^3 This corresponds to a cube with sides 2.8 \u00d7 10^-7 cm, which is the mean distance between molecules. The mean square speed is calculated from (1/2)mv^2= (3/2)kT where m is the mass of one molecule of nitrogen,v^2is the mean square speed of the molecule, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Furthermore, since k = R/N_0 where R is the gas constant and N_o is Avogadro's number, and mN_0 = M where M is the mass of one mole of gas, we have: v^2 = [(3kT)/m] = (3RT)/(N_0m) = (3RT)/M v^2 = (3 \u00d7 8.313 joule/\\textdegreek mole \u00d7 473\\textdegree k)/(2.8 \u00d7 10^-3 kg/mole) = (3 \u00d7 8.313 kg-m^2/s^2 \\textdegreek mole \u00d7 473\\textdegree k)/(28 \u00d7 10^-3 kg/mole) = 4.21 \u00d7 10^5 m^2/sec^2 Thus the average speed c of a molecule is c = \\surd(v^2) = 6.5 \u00d7 10^2 m/sec. When two molecules of radius r collide, their centers are a distance 2r apart. Therefore, a molecule travelling along a straight line will collide with other molecules within a distance 2r of its center (we assume a simplified model in which one molecule moves and the others remain stationary and in which all collisions are elastic). During a time \u2206t, the molecule which we are following travels a distance c\u2206t. Thus, the molecules with which our molecule will collide are all found within a cylinder of base radius 2r and height c\u2206t. This cylinder is called the collision cylinder. If N is the number of molecules in volume V, then the density of molecules is N/V. If we multiply the volume of the cylinder by the density of molecules we will have the number of molecules in the cylinder (4\\pir^2c\u2206tN/V). Dividing this quantity by \u2206t we have the number of collisions per unit time (4\\pir^2cN/V) . The average time between collisions is the reciprocal of this, called the mean free time (V/4\\pir^2cN). If we multiply this by the average velocity, we have the average distance a molecule travels before colliding with another (the mean free path): L = (cV)/(4\\pir^2 cN) = V/(4\\pir^2N) Substituting our values, we have (in the present case let r = 1.3 \u00d7 10^-10 m): L = [16.7 \\pi 10^-3 m^3]/[4\\pi(1.3 \u00d7 10^-10 m)^2(1.29 moles)(6.023 \u00d710^23 moles^-1) = 1.01 x 10^-7 m", "images": ["images/D14-0493_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Physics/D14-0493.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The average speed of the nitrogen molecules is 6.5 \u00d7 10^2 m/sec, the mean distance between molecules is 2.8 \u00d7 10^-7 cm, and the average distance a molecule travels before colliding with another is 1.01 x 10^-7 m."}

{"question": "List the common types of registers used in the computer and statetheir purpose.", "solution": "There are nine types of registers in the computer. 1.Program Counter:This register holds the address of the instruction tobe executed.

The MBR alsostores information that is to be transferred from a register into main memory. 5.Accumulator:This register stores temporary data during calculations.

This numerical address is com-prised of adisplacement and the contents of a base register. The base register holdsthe address at which the program was stored in main memory upon itsentry. The displacement is the distance (i.e. the number of bytes) which aninstruction is from the start of the program.

{"question": "How has the role of internal body secretions in behavior been demonstrated in silk worms?", "solution": "Although much of the stimuli which trigger specific behavioral responses have an external origin, many responses occur as a result of internal stimulation. Much of this internal stimulation is initiated by hormones. The silkworm larva must spin its cocoon at a certain time in life, just following its larval stage. The stimulus for the spinning behavior comes from the disappearance of a specific substance, juvenile hormone. This is secreted by the corporaallata, a pair of glands located behind the brain of the silkworm. The secretion of juvenile hormone prevents the spinning of the cocoon. As the larva grows, the level of juvenile hormone drops, allowing for the spinning reaction to occur. No external sign stimuli is necessary, only internal hormonal levels.

The total number of possible combinations is 2^n, where n is the number of heterozygous traits involved in the cross. For the first parent (Tt Yy Ss), n equals 3 and the total combinations is 2^3 or 8. The genotypes of these eight gametes can be de-termined by using a dichotimous branching system (or forkedline method).

(2) What is the ratio of the final kineticenergy to the initial kinetic energy? (3) What is the motion of the center of mass of this system before and after collision? (4) Describe the motion before and after the collision in the reference frame in which the center of mass is at rest.", "solution": "The basic principle used in solving a collision problem is the law of conservation of total momentum. This principle may be applied to any collision, so long as there are no external forces (forces due to the outside environment) acting on the system. From figures (1) and (2), we see that the initial momentum is M_1v^\\ding{217}_1, and the final momentum is (M_1 + M_2)v^\\ding{217}, and we obtain M_1v_1^\\ding{217} = (M1+ M_2) v^\\ding{217} v^\\ding{217} = [M1/ (M_1 + M_2)] v_1^\\ding{217} Hence, (M_1 + M_2) moves with velocity v^\\ding{217}, parallel to v_1^\\ding{217}. (2) The kinetic energy k_f after the collision is K_f = (1/2) (M1+ M_2)v^2 = (1/2) (M_1 + M_2) [(M1^2v1^2) / (M_1 + M_2)^2] Kf= [(M_1^2 + v_1^2)] / [2(M_1 + M_2)] The initial kinetic energy, k_i is (1/2) M_1v1^2, hence kf/k_i = (M_1^2v_1^2)/[2(M_1 + M_2)] \\bullet [1/(1/2 M_1V_1^2)] = [M_1/(M_1 + M_2)] k_f/k_i = [1 - {M_2/(M_1 + M_2)}] The difference, k_i - k_f, is lost to increased internal motion in the (M_1 + M_2) system (i.e. internal excitations and heat). When a meteorite (M_1) strikes and sticks to the earth (M_2),essentially all the kinetic energy of the meteorite will be lost to heat in the earth. This follows from the fact that if M_2 >> M_1, k_f/k_i = [M_1/(M_1 + M_2)] = [1/{1 + (M_2/M_1)}] \\approx0 Hence, k_f \\approx0 and all the initial kinetic energy is transformed into heat. (3)The center of mass of a system of particles is a fictitious point whose motion is supposed to describe the trajectory of an imaginary bag which contains all the particles in that system. As the particles move around, the shape and the volume of this bag changes but not its momentum. The interactions of particles among themselves cannot result in a net-resultant force or change in momentum of the bag as a result of the action- reaction principle (for each force exerted on one particle by the others, there is an equal and opposite force exerted by this particle on the others). Furthermore, the collisions of particles with each other conserve the momentum of the colliding particles in each collision and cannot change the total momentum of the bag. In this way, we can view the motion of the center of mass as represent-ing the net effect of only the external forces on the system. If there are no external forces, then the center of mass will not change its velocity, irrespective of the final velocities of the particles. The position of the center of mass is given by R_cm^\\ding{217} = (Sum of all m_iv_i^\\ding{217})/(M_t) where m_i and r_i^\\ding{217} are the masses and the positions of individual particles, M_t is the total mass. In our problem, let the collision take place at the origin of our coordi-nate system and at time t = 0. After the collision, the center of mass will just coincide with the mass (M_1 + M_2) and we have R_cm^\\ding{217} = vt^\\ding{217} = [M_1/(M_1 + M_2)] v_1^\\ding{217}_ t The center of the mass velocity is v_cm^\\ding{217} = (sum of all p_i^\\ding{217})/(M_t) where p_i^\\ding{217} are the individual moment. For our problem v_cm^\\ding{217} = v^\\ding{217}=[M_1/(M_1 + M_2)] v_1^\\ding{217} This expression for the velocity of center of mass will be true for all times, i.e. also before the collision (for which t < 0). (4) In this reference frame v_cm^\\ding{217} = 0. (This reference frame is attached to the center of mass of the system.) The new velocity of M_1 with respect to this observerwill be the velocity of M_1 in the old frame minus thevelocity of the c.m. frame with respect to the old frame or u_1^\\ding{217} = v_1^\\ding{217} - v_cm^\\ding{217} = [M_2/(M_1+ M_2)] v_1^\\ding{217} and, for M2 u_2^\\ding{217} = v_2^\\ding{217} -v_cm^\\ding{217}= - v_cm^\\ding{217} = - [M_1/(M_1 + M_2)] v_2^\\ding{217} This result for u^\\ding{217}_2 could be guessed right away.When the observer was in the old frame,M_2 was station-ary.

After this, write out the equilibrium constant expression. This allows one to calculate the [H^+].

With this in mind, proceed as follows: An indicator, which changes color, undergoes a dissociation reaction like an acid. For phenolphthalein the reaction is HIn\\rightarrow H^+ + In^-. It is given that In^- makes the solution red andHInmakes it colorless. The equilibrium constant expression, which measures the ratio of concentrations of products to re-actants, each raised to the power of its coefficient in the equation, is K_diss= 10^-9 = {[H^+][In^-]}/[HIn] The object is to make a red solution, from an originally colorless one. In general, a specific color of an indicator will show itself when the concentration of the corresponding species is 10 times as great as the concentration of the other species. Since one wants the solution to be red, and In^- = red color, [ln^-]/[HIn] = 10/1. Substituting this into the equilibrium constant expression, 10^-9 = [H^+] (10/1) . Solving for [H^+], [H^+] = 10^-10. From the K_W constant of water, it is known that [H^+][OH^-] = 10^-14 , where K_W is theautodissociationconstant of H_2O.

The end result of their actions is varied. Though they are expected to be valuable in treating many ailments, from nasal congestion to hypertension, their most significant use may be in birth control. Prostaglandins induce strong contractions in the uterus, and hence they may be powerful agents for abortion. As abortive agents, the prostaglandins efficient in almost all of the cases where they are used. When more is known about the side effects of pros-taglandins, it is believed that their application in abortion would be safer than mechanical means.

{"question": "What is bile and what is its role in digestion? Where is bile manufactured and how does it reach the food undergoing digestion?", "solution": "Bile is very important for proper digestion, although it contains no enzymes. It is highly alkaline and helps neutralize the acid in the chyme as it leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine. This is necessary in order for the intestinal enzymes to function properly. Bile is composed of bile salts, lecithin, cholesterol and bile pigments. The first three are involved in the emulsification of fat in the small intestine. The bile pigments give bile its color. The major bile pigment is bilirubin. Bilirubin is actually a breakdown product of hemoglobin, the oxygen- carrying protein in red blood cells. In the large intestine, bilirubin and other bile pigments are further converted by bacteria into brown pigments, which give rise to the color of feces. If the bile duct is blocked so that the pigments cannot be excreted in the bile, they will be reabsorbed by the liver. Eventually, the pigments will accumulate in the blood and tissues, giving the skin a yellow color; this condition is called jaundice. Cholesterol is a large fat-like molecule that has a very low solubility in body fluids. This may lead to deposits of cholesterol in the heart and arteries, which could result in heart disease or arteriosclerosis. The liver excretes excess cholesterol in the bile. Gallstones result from the accumulation of excess insoluble cholesterol in the gallbladder. Bile salts are the most active part of bile. They are salts of glycocholic acid, which is made from cholesterol. Unlike cholesterol, bile salts are very soluble. These salts are essential for digestion of fats. Butter and oil are fats which constitute part of a group of molecules called lipids. Lipid molecules are insoluble in water and tend to coalesce to form globules. The enzymes that digest lipids, called lipases, can only work on the surface of these globules. Alone, it would take weeks for lipases to complete fat digestion in this manner. Bile salts solve this problem by having detergent-like properties - they coat the globules and break them up into millions of tiny droplets called micelles. This process, called emulsification, greatly increases the surface area exposed to attack by lipases, speeding up lipid digestion. Bile salts are conserved by the body, and are reabsorbed in the lower part of the intestine, carried back to the liver through the bloodstream, and secreted again. The liver, one of the body's largest organs, constantly secretes bile. (600 - 800 ml. a day) A network of ducts collects the bile and passes it into the gallbladder, where it is stored until needed. The gallbladder is a small muscular sac that lies on the surface of the liver. When food enters the duodenum, certain receptor cells in the wall of the intestine sense the presence of fats in the chyme. Stimulated by the fats, the receptor cells in the duodenum secrete a hormone, called cholecystokinin (CCK) into the bloodstream. This hormone causes inhibiton of gastric motility and contraction of the gallbladder, forcing bile out through the bile duct and into the small intestine.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F17-0436.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Bile is a highly alkaline substance that helps neutralize the acid in the chyme as it leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine.

In other words, a function may be required to contain certain minterms, omit certain minterms, with the remaining minterms being optional; that is certain minterms may be included in the logic design if they help simplify the logic circuit. A minterm which is optional is called a don't care minterm. The plotting of the given function f(A,B,C,D) is shown in fig. 1 . In the use of don't cares there is one additional rule which may be used in mapping. Recall that the don't cares by definition can be either 0 or 1. Hence in minimizing terms in Sum of Product form, the don't cares may be chosen to be 1 if in doing so the set of blocks on the map which can be grouped together is larger than would other-wise be possible without including the don't cares.

{"question": "Explain how a change of one base on the DNA can result in sickle-cellhemoglobin rather than normal hemoglobin.", "solution": "If one base within a portion of DNA comprising a gene is altered, andthat gene is transcribed, the codon for one amino acid on the mRNA willbe dif-ferent. The polypeptide chain which is translated from that mRNA maythen have a different amino acid at this position. Although there are hundredsof amino acids in a protein, a change of only one can have far-reaching effects. The human hemoglobin molecule is composed of two halves of protein, each half formed by two kinds of polypeptide chains, namely an alphachain and a beta chain. In persons suffering from sickle-cell anemia,.amutation has occurred in the gene which forms the beta chain. As a result, a single amino acid substitution occurs, whereglutamicacid is replacedbyvaline. Onecodonforglutamicacid is AUG, while one for valineis UUG. (A = adenine, U = uracil, G = guanine). If U is substituted forA in thecodonforglutamicacid, thecodonwill specifyvaline. Thus, it iseasy to see how a change in a single base has resulted in this amino acidsubstitu-tion. This change is so important, however, that the entire hemoglobinmolecule behaves differently. When the oxygen level in the blooddrops, the altered molecules tend to form end to end associations andthe entire red blood cell is forced out of shape, forming a sickle- shaped body. These may aggregate to block the capillaries. More importantly, thesesickledcells cannot carry oxygen properly and a person havingthem suffers from severe hemolytic anemia, which usually leads to deathearly in life. The condition is known as sickle-cell anemia. In a normal hemoglobin molecule, theglutamicacid residue in question , being charged, is located on the outside of the hemoglobin moleculewhere it is in contact with the aqueous medium.

{"question": "What type of mirror is required to form an image, on a wall 3 m from the mirror, of the filament of a headlight lamp 10 cm in front of the mirror? What is the height of the image if the height of the object Is 5 mm?", "solution": "The image I has to be real since it appears on the wall. Therefore, we must use a concave mirror and the object 0 must be placed beyond the focal point F for a real image (see the figure). We rule out a convex mirror since one cannot obtain images that can be shown on a screen with a convex mirror. If p and q are the object and image distances from the mirror respect-ively, the first mirror equation is (1/p) + (1/q) = (1/f) where f = (R/2) is the focal distance of the mirror. Therefore, we have p = 10 cm,q = 300 cm. (1/10 cm) + (1/300 cm) = (2/R), and R = 19.4 cm. The radius R has a positive sign, as it is required for a concave mirror.

{"question": "When ultraviolet light of frequency 1.3 \u00d7 10^15 sec^-1 is shined on a metal, photoelectrons are ejected with a maximum energy of 1.8 electron volts. Calculate the work function of the metal in ergs and electron volts. What is the threshold frequency of this metal?", "solution": "This problem is an example of the photo- electric effect. We want to relate the work function of a metal to the energy of the incident radiation. (The work function is the amount of energy needed to release an electron from the attraction of the rest of the metal, and thereby pull it out of the metal.) Let us examine the reaction occurring. A photon of energyhu(the ultraviolet radiation) collides with an electron of the metal, and, in the process, gives up all of its energy. Ifhuis large enough, the electron will travel through the metal and be released with kinetic energy (1/2) mv^2, where m and v are the electron mass and velocity, respectively. In leaving the metal, the electron loses energy due to collisions with atoms of the metal. The electron also loses energy, equal in amount to the work function, in order to overcome the attraction of the metal and escape. If we examine only those electrons which lie close to the surface of the metal, we observe that they do not go through any collisions and hence can-not lose energy by this means. These surface electrons lose less energy than the interior electrons and there-fore will have a maximum amount of kinetic energy when they leave the metal. Using the principle of conservation of energy, we obtain hu= (1/2) m v^2_max + \\textphi(1) where \\textphi is the work function of the metal. (Note that this relation is true only for surface electrons.) Solving (1) for \\textphi, we obtain \\textphi =hu- (1/2) mv^2_max(2) The energy of a photon of the ultraviolet light is hu= 6.625 \u00d7 10^-27 \u00d7 1.3 \u00d7 10^15 erg = 8.61 \u00d7 10^-12 erg Since 1 electron volt = 1.60 \u00d7 10^-12 erg, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons is (1/2) mv^2_max = 1.8 X 1.6 X 10^-12 erg = 2.88 X 10^-12 erg From equation 2, the work function is \\textphi =hu- (1/2) mv^2_max = 8.61 X 10^-12 - 2.88 X 10^-12 erg = 5.73 X 10^-12 erg Since 1 erg = .625 \u00d7 10^12eV \\textphi = (5.73 \u00d7 10^-12 erg) [.625 \u00d7 10^12 (eV/erg)] \\textphi = 3.58eV The threshold frequency is the smallest frequency of indecent radiation for which the electrons will be released from the metal with no kinetic energy.

Mucus is a polymer made up ofrepeating units of a protein- sugar complex. A coat of mucus, about 1 to 1(1/2) millimeters in thickness, lines the inner surface of the stomach. Mucus is slightly basic. This alkalinity provides a barrier to acids, keeping thearea next to the stomach lining nearly neutral. In addition, the membranesof the cells lining the stomach have a low permeability to hydrogenions, preventing acid from entering the underlying cells. The cells that make up the stomach (and duodenum) lining do not lastlong, even under this protection. Cell division and growth replace the entirestomach lining every 1 to 3 days.

(B) Find the initial concentrations of the three species. (C) Relate the final concentrations to the initial concentrations. (D) Solve for [Ca++], [SO--_4 ], and [Sr++] . (A)K_sp, the solubility product constant, equals the product of the concentrations of the ions in a saturated solution. Thus, K_sp= CaSO_4 = [Ca++] [SO--_4 ]andK_sp= SrSO_4 = [Sr++] [SO--_4 ] .

The number of moles of Na_2SO_4 present is, therefore, (molarity) (volume) = (0.3) (0.01) = 0.003 moles of Na_2SO_4 . Since the salt dissociates completely, there are 0.003 moles of SO--_4 in the solution. The new volume is (0.02 + 0.01) liters = 0.03 l, after adding the Ca++ andSr++ solu-tion. Thus, the initial molarityof SO--_4 is : (0.003moles)/ (0.03 liter) = 0.1 M. By similar analysis, it follows that the initial concentration ofSr++ = initial concentration of Ca++ = 0.0667M .

{"question": "Why are genetic ratios more reliable when there are large numbers of offspring? Discuss the above with a reference to one inherited character in human beings.", "solution": "Genetic ratios are often misunderstood. When we say that a certain type of cross yields a three-to-one ratio, this does not mean that for every four offspring, there will always be three of one type and one of another. A ratio is worked out on the basis of mathematical pro-bability and will be approached when large numbers are considered. In tossing a coin there is an equal probability of obtaining either a head or a tail, and the ratio of heads to tails would be 1:1. This is because each toss or event is independent of, and therefore not influenced by, the results of any preceding or subsequent tosses. The 50% chance of obtaining either side of the coin is the pro-bability within which each individual event operates, and does not change, regardless of the number of time the event occurs. However, when the event takes place a large number of times, the results do tend to average out to the expected probability, and the actual ratio approaches the anticipated ratio of 1/2. The same is true for certain genetic events. For instance, the cross between a heterozygous brown-eyed man (Bb) and a blue-eyed woman (bb) would be depicted as the following: p Each offspring produced has a 1/2 chance of being brown eyed and a 1/2 chance of being blue eyed. Thus, the expected ratios are; 1 Bb : 1 bb; or phenotypically, 1 brown : 1 blue. We might expect then, a one-to-one ratio in eye color among their offspring. But suppose their first child had blue eyes. This does not automatically mean that their second child must have brown eyes. That child has, like the first child, an equal probability of being either brown or blue-eyed; either outcome is equally probable regardless of what eye color the first child has. This is because the separation of alleles in gamete formation is, like a coin toss, a purely random event, not effected by preceding events. So, while we know that in this case the egg can only be carrying the gene for blue eyes, (because the female in this case is homozygous for blue eyes) . The gene carried by the sperm that will fertilize the egg has an equal chance of being brown or blue, and we cannot predict which it will be because of the randomness of gene segregation. Therefore, though we might expect a one-to-one ratio for brown-eyed and blue-eyed offspring, the actual ratio may deviate from expected entirely by chance. However - and this is the important point - if we were to tabulate the eye color of thousands of children from many families of parents having the same genotypic combinations as this couple, we would indeed find that close to one half of them will have blue eyes and the other half will have brown eyes. As was the case for the coin toss, the larger our sampling population, the closer our ratio approaches one-to-one, the expected ratio.

What is meant by the term secondarily radial?", "solution": "The bodies of most animals are symmetrical, that is, the body can be cut into two equivalent halves. In radial symmetry any plane which runs through the central axis from top to bottom divides the body into two equal halves. In bilateral symmetry, only one plane passes through the central body axis, that can divide the body into equal halves. In a bilateral body plant, six sides are distinguished: front (ventral), back (dorsal), head-end (anterior),tailend(posterior), left, and right. (Most animals are not perfectly symmetrical; for example, in man, the heart is located more to the left, the right lung is larger than the left lung, and the liver is found on the right side of the body.) Coelenterata(including the hydras, the true jelly-fishes, the sea anemones, sea fans and corals) andCtenophora(including the comb jellies and sea walnuts) are two radiate phyla. Their members have radially sym-metrical bodies that are at a relatively simple level of construction. They have no distinct internal organs, no head, and no central nervous systems though they possess nerve nets. There is a digestive tract with only one opening serving as both mouth and anus, and there is no internal space orcoelombetween the wall of the digestive cavity and the outer body wall. These animals have two distinct tissue layers: an outer epidermis (derived from embryonic ectoderm) and an innergastrodermis(derived from em-bryonic endoderm). A third tissue layer,mesoglea(mesoderm) is usually also present between the epidermis andgastrodermis. Often gelatinous in nature, it is not a well- developed layer, and has only a few scattered cells, which may be amoeboid or fibrous. Coelenterates and ctenophores are mostly sedentary organisms. Some are sessile at some stage of their life cycles, while others are completely sessile throughout their lives. The higher animals are usually bilateral in symmetry. The flatworms and the proboscis worms are regarded as the most primitive bilaterally symmetrical animals. They are however far more advanced than the coelenterates and ctenophores. Both have bodies composed of three well-developed tissue layers - ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Their body structures show a greater degree of organization than theradially symmetrical animals. Although there are no respiratory and circulatory systems, there is a flame- cell excretory system, and well-developed reproductive organs (usually both male and female in each individual). Mesodermal muscles show an advance in construction; cir-cular and longitudinal muscle layers are developed for purposes of locomotion and/or alteration of body shape. Several longitudinal nerve cords running the length of the body and a tiny \"brain\" ganglion located in the head are present which together constitute a central nervous system. In higher bilaterally symmetrical animals, there is observed a trend toward more complicated construction of the body. Separate organ systems are developed, specializing in dif-ferent functions. There is also a separation of sexes in individuals so that each individual produces only one kind of gametes (male or female but not both). The echinoderms areradiallysymmetrical animals. The phylum Echinodermata includes sea stars (starfish), sea urchins, sea cucumbers, sand dollars, brittle stars, and sealillies. These animals are fairly complex; they have a digestive organ system, a nervous system, and a reproductive system. The echinoderms are believed to have evolved from a bilaterally symmetrical ancestor. Also, whereas the adults exhibit radial symmetry, echinoderm larvae are bilaterally symmetrical. For these reasons, the echinoderms are considered to be secondarilyradiallysymmetrical. (The echinoderms will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 12.)", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F11-0290.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Radially symmetrical animals are at a lower evolutionary stage because their bodies are relatively simple in construction with no distinct internal organs, no head, and no central nervous systems.

{"question": "What is an operon? With the aid of diagrams, show how a known operon works.", "solution": "A controllable unit of transcription is called an operon. An operon consists of a binding site for RNA polymerase (a promoter), a binding site for a specific repressor (an operator), and one or more structural genes (see figure). These structural genes are usually associated in their functions, and their coordinated synthesis is de-sirable. Thus they are linked together in the operon, and when they are transcribed, a single mRNA molecule is produced. The promotor and operator act as controls for this trans-cription, and the entire system is controlled by an associated regulatory gene, which codes for the repressor molecule of the operon. A known example of an operon is the lactose (lac) operon, present in E. coli. This operon contains the structural genes for \\beta-galactosidase, an enzyme which cleaves lactose into glucose and galactose; galactoside permease, which allows for the increased rate of entry of lactose into the bacteria; and galactoside acetylase, whose function is not known. When lactose is absent from the medium, these enzymes are not needed, and so their levels are low. But when lactose is added to the medium containing these bacteria, the production of the enzymes increases tremendously, almost a thousand fold. How is the manufacture of this prodigious quantity of enzyme initiated and controlled? The regulatory gene (1) for the lac operon is transcribed constitutively, that is, its product, the repressor, is constantly being synthesized. This repressor binds to the operator(o) and blocks the transcription of the structural genes. That is why the levels of the three enzymes are normally so low. The situation is altered when lactose is introduced into the medium. Lactose molecules move into the nucleus of the bacterium, and bind to any repressor molecules in such a way that the repressors are inactivated. An inactivated rep-ressor cannot bind to the operator. It therefore cannot block the transcription of the structural genes by RNApoly-merase which binds to the promotor. Messenger RNA now transcribed from the genes of the operon is translated on the ribosomes into the three enzymes of lactose metabolism. As long as the inducer (lactose) is present, the synthesis of the enzymes can occur. But when the inducer is depleted by metabolism, repressor proteins (remember that synthesis of the lac repressor isconstitutive) become free to again bind to the operator and effectively turn off the synthesis of the enzymes. This model implies that the usual condition of the lactose operon is to be turned off. This is accomplished through the control of the regulator gene, which constitu-tively produces the repressor. In other words, the system is under negative control. Because the operon can be turned on by the presence of lactose (the inducer), it is said to be inducible. An important implication is that some genes, such as (1), produce proteins whose function is to regulate the expression of other genes, while certain other genes, namely operators and promoters, very probably do not code for any proteins at all.", "images": ["images/F24-0631_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F24-0631.htm", "image_question": true, "image_answer": true, "short_answer": false, "answer": "A controllable unit of transcription is called an operon."}

{"question": "Discuss the basic features of the molluscan body. How do they differ in the several classes of mollusks ?", "solution": "The phylum Mollusca is the second largest in the animal kingdom. Snails, clams, oysters, slugs, squids, and octopuses are among the best known molluscs. The adult body plan is remarkably different from that of any other group of invertebrates. The soft body consists of three principal parts: (1) a large ventral muscular foot which can be extruded from the shell (if a shell is present) and functions in locomotion; (2) a visceral mass above the foot, containing most of the organs of the body; and (3) a mantle, a heavy fold of tissue that covers the visceral mass. In most species, the mantle contains glands that secrete a shell. The mantle often projects over the edges of the foot and overhangs the sides of the visceral mass, thus enclosing a mantle cavity, in which gills frequently lie. The chitons, members of the class Amphineura, have an ovoid bilaterally symmetrical body with an anterior mouth and posterior anus. They have paired excretory organs, nerves, gonads, and gills. The shell consists of eight dorsal plates. Class Gastropoda is a large class, containing the snails, slugs and their relatives. Most gastropods have a coiled shell; however, in some species, coiling is minimal, and in others, the shell has been lost. The body plan of the adult gastropods is not symmetrical. During develop-ment, two rotations of the body occur, so that the anus comes to lie dorsal to the head in the anterior part of the body. The organs on one side of the body atrophy, so that the adult has one heart, one kidney, one gonad, and one gill. This embryonic twisting, called torsion, occurs in all gastropods, including those with a flat shell, slugs and other species without a shell Class Pelecypoda or Bivalvia contains the bivalves. These mollusks have two hinged shells. Scallops, clams, mussels, and oysters are well known bivalves. These animals have well-developed muscles for opening and clos-ing the shells. These animals also have a muscular siphon for the intake and output of water. The nautilus squid, and octopus are members of the class cephalopoda. Cephalopod means head-foot, and in these molluscs the foot is fused with the head. In squids and octopuses, the foot is divided into ten or eight tentacles, and the shell is greatly reduced or absent.

To obtainan average the service time remaining for each car, the total waitingtime for all the cars, and the number of cars that are lined up must befound. For each simulated minute, the program must reduce the service time SERV by one and check to see if another car has arrived.If so, the waiting timefor that last car is given by SERV. WAIT - the total waiting time, is increasedby adding SERV to it, while the number of cars, CARTOT, is Increased by one, and SERV is increased by six minutes.

{"question": "What are the three laws of thermodynamics? Discuss their biological significance.", "solution": "The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can be converted from one form into another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. In other words, the energy of a closed system is constant. Thus, the first law is simply a statement of the law of conservation of energy. The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy (a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system) of the universe is increasing. This is characterized by a decrease in the free energy, which is the energy available to do work. Thus, any spontaneous change that occurs (chemical, physical, or biological) will tend to increase the entropy of the universe. The third law of thermodynamics refers to a com-pletely ordered system, particularly, a perfect crystal. It states that a perfect crystal at absolute zero (O Kelvin) would have perfect order, and therefore its entropy would be zero. These three laws affect the biological as well as the chemical and physical world. Living cells do their work by using the energy stored in chemical bonds. The first law of thermodynamics states that every chemical bond in a given molecule contains an amount of energy equal to the amount that was necessary to link the atoms together. Thus, living cells are both transducers that turn other forms of energy into chemical bond energy and liberators that free this energy by utilizing the chemical bond energy to do work. Considering that a living organism is a storehouse of potential chemical energy due to the many millions of atoms bonded together in each cell, it might appear that the same energy could be passed continuously from organism to organism with no required extracellular energy source. However, deeper consideration shows this to be false. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that every energy transformation results in a reduction in the usable or free energy of the system. Consequently, there is a steady increase in the amount of energy that is unavailable to do work (an increase in entropy). In addition, energy is constantly being passed from living organisms to non-living matter (e.g., when you write you expend energy to move the pencil, when it is cold out your body loses heat to warm the air, etc.). The system of living organisms thus cannot be a static energy system, and must be replenished by energy derived from the non-living world. The second law of thermodynamics is also helpful in explaining the loss of energy from the system at each successive trophic level in a food pyramid. In the following food pyramid, The energy at the producer level is greater than the energy at the consumer I level which is greater than the energy of the consumer II level. Every energy transformation between the members of the successive levels involves the loss of usable energy, and this loss serves to increase the entropy. Thus, this unavoidable loss causes the total amount of energy at each trophic level to be lower than at the preceding level .", "images": ["images/F01-0007_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F01-0007.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can be converted from one form into another, but it cannot be created or destroyed.

{"question": "Show by diagrams how genes located on different pairs of chromosomes segregate independently in meiosis in an organism with a diploid number of four.", "solution": "Because there are two possible ways in which the chromosomes can line up and segregate in meiosis I, there are two possible sets of gametes that could be formed by meiosis. Each set has 2 pairs of identical gametes. There are thus 4 types of gametes possible. We know this from looking at the genotypes of the parental cell (Aa Bb) . Four combinations of these genes are possible:AB, Ab, aB, and ab. All these gametes have been produced in the two possible meiotic divisions. It is important to note, however, that each separate meiosis produced only two types of gametes - AB and ab or Ab and aB - and only in these combinations . Gametic genotype combinations such as AB and Ab or aB and ab could not be produced in the same meiotic division. Although there are eight chromosomes in total, the separation of homologs occurs as a function of duplicated chromosomes. Thus, if in meiosis I, AA is paired with BB, aa must be paired with bb. If AA is paired with bb, then aa must be paired with BB. The genotypes of the gametes produced in a meiotic division are determined in meiosis I, and meiosis II is merely a mitotic type division resulting in the separation of identical daughter chromosomes. In meiotic gamete formation, the randomness of the way the chromosomes line up is one method that ensures genetic variation. Diverse gamates, differing in their combinations of chromosomes, are produced by the independent assortment of chromosomes when they first segregate in meiosis. In a cell with many chromosomes, such as a human cell with 23 pairs, the number of possible gametes that could be produced is very large indeed.", "images": ["images/F25-0645_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F25-0645.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": true, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Four combinations of these genes are possible:AB, Ab, aB, and ab."}

{"question": "SO_2CI_2 \\rightarrow SO_2 + CI_2 is 8.0 minutes. In what period of time would the con-centration of SO_2CI_2 be reduced to 1.0% of the original?", "solution": "If a reaction is first order, it means that the rate of the reaction is proportional to the concentration of a single reactant. For example, if substance A decomposes into the products B and C, A \\rightarrow B + C, the rate is proportional to the concentration of A which is present at any time. Rate = k [A], where k is the rate constant for the reaction and [A] is the concentration of A. The rate at which the reaction proceeds is equal to the decrease in concentration of A with change of time. This can be written in the integrated form 2.303 log {[A] / [A_0]} = -kt, where [A] is the concentration of A after time t has elapsed, [A_0 ] is the original concentration of A and k is the rate constant for the reaction. In this problem, the final ratio of [A] to [A_0]is given as 1.0% or 0.010. Therefore, this equation can be used to find the time it takes for this process to occur, once one has calculated the rate constant k. The rate constant can be found if one remembers the relationship between the half-life of a reaction and k. Namely, t_1/2 =0.693 / k , where t, is the half life and k is the rate constant. The 1/2for this reaction is given as 8.0 minutes, therefore this relation can be used to obtain k. K = 0.693/ t_1/2 k = 0.693 / 8.0 minutes = 0.087 / minute Once k is known, it can be used in the original rate equation to determine the time it takes for this reaction to proceed until the concentration of A is 1.0% that of the original concentration. 2.303 log {[A] / [A_0]} = -kt.Substituting, 2.303log0.010 = - 0.087 / minute\u00d7 t t = {(2.303log0.010) / (- 0.087 / min)} = {(2.303) (-2)} / (- 0.087 / min) = 53 minutes.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E13-0463.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "53 minutes"}

The distance between two adjacent threads is called the pitch (p) of the screw, as shown in the figure. As the handle is turned through one complete revolution, the weight moves through distance p. At the same time, the man's hand moves a distance 2\\piR. The displacement ratio DR, is the distance the man's hand moves divided by the resultant displacement of the screw: DR = (2\\piR)/p = [(2\\pi) (1.8 ft) (12 in/ft)] / [0.15 in] = 144 (b) The efficiency is defined as the ratio of work output to work input.

{"question": "Discuss and illustrate the meaning of absolute and relative addressing.", "solution": "One does not need an in depth knowledge of com-puter science to realize that any program loaded into the main memory of a computer is stored at a particular address. In basic assembler language, by means of a BALR instruction, the address of the first instruction of the program is al-ways placed in a base register. We can safely say that this address never has location \"zero.\" This is so because the first section of the computer's memory is reserved for the operating system. If we call the address at which the pro-gram is loaded its ENTRY address, then, in general, to cal-culate the address of any of the program's symbols, we must add the distance (number of bytes) that is between the sym-bol and the ENTRY address to the ENTRY address. For example if the ENTRY address' location is 925 and the symbol is 48 bytes away, then the address of the symbol is 925 + 48 = 973; the symbol is at location 973. The ENTRY address and the process of adding the displacement dictate what is known as the absolute address of the program and its symbols. In fact, the absolute address of a symbol is its actual loca-tion in main memory. In relative addressing however, we are only interested in the positions which statements occupy relative to the beginning of the program. As a result of this we do not concern ourselves with the contents of the base register (since it is constant for all statements in the program) in calculating this address. The relative address is merely the distance of a particular statement from the beginning of the program.

{"question": "Two men, each of whom weighs 150 lb, stand opposite each other on the rim of a small uniform circular platform which weighs 900 lb. Each man simultaneously walks clockwise and at a fixed speed once around the rim. The platform is free to rotate about a vertical axis through its center. Find the angle in space through which each man has turned. (The platform's moment of inertia is I = (1/2)MR^2 , where M is its mass).", "solution": "The figure (parts (a) through (c)) illustrates various posi-tions of the 2 men, and the platform, relative to an observer on the ground. Our ultimate goal is to find an equation, for each man, de-scribing his angular position, \\texttheta, as a function of time, relative to his initial position figure (a)). It is equally acceptable to find an equation for the angular velocity \\omega^\\ding{217} of each man, since this may be integrated to find \\texttheta. Rather than jumping right into a dynamic analysis of this problem, it might be worth our while to see if we can use any conservation relations in solving this problem. Note that the angular momentum of the system consisting of the 2 men and platform is constant in time, since no external torques (i.e., friction) act on the system. Furthermore, using angular momentum as our conserved quantity will give us a relation between the angular kinematical variables (\\alpha,\\omega,\\texttheta) at 2 times during the motion of the system. We take these 2 times to be as illustrated in figures (a) and (b). The initial angular momentum of the system, L_0, is zero, since figure (a) shows the system at rest. The final angular momentum, L_F^\\ding{217}, is due to the angular momentum of each man(L_1^\\ding{217}.L_2^\\ding{217}) plus the platform's angular moment-um, L_p^\\ding{217}. Hence L_f^\\ding{217} = L_1^\\ding{217} + L_2^\\ding{217} + L_p^\\ding{217}(1) But, by the definition of the angular momentum of a particle about point C, L_1^\\ding{217} = r_1^\\ding{217} \u00d7 p_1^\\ding{217} L_2^\\ding{217} = r_2^\\ding{217} \u00d7 p_2^\\ding{217} where p_1^\\ding{217} and p_2^\\ding{217} are the linear momentum of each men, and r_1^\\ding{217} and r_2^\\ding{217} are as illustrated in figure (a). Also, form figure (b) r_1^\\ding{217} = -r_2^\\ding{217} p_1^\\ding{217} = -p_2^\\ding{217} since each man walks with the same velocity. Then L_1^\\ding{217} = r_1^\\ding{217} \u00d7 p_1^\\ding{217} andL_2^\\ding{217} = r_1^\\ding{217} \u00d7 p_1^\\ding{217}(2) Furthermore, the angular momentum of the platform is L_p^\\ding{217} = I \\omega^\\ding{217}(3) where \\omega^\\ding{217} and I are its angular velocity and moment of inertia relative to C. (See figure (a)).

(figure (a)). Finally \\texttheta' - \\texttheta'_0 = [(-I)/(2mR^2)](\\texttheta - \\texttheta_0) This relates the net angle traversed by each man (relative to an observer on the ground) to the net angle which the platform rotates through. Using the given data \\texttheta' - \\texttheta'_0 = -[{(1/2)(MR^2)}/(2mR^2)](\\texttheta - \\texttheta_0) = (-M)/(4m)(\\texttheta - \\texttheta_0) \\texttheta' - \\texttheta'_0 = [(-Mg)/(4mg)](\\texttheta - \\texttheta_0) = [(-900 lb)/(600 lb)](\\texttheta - \\texttheta_0) \\texttheta' - \\texttheta'_0 = -(3/2)(\\texttheta - \\texttheta_0)(12) Each man makes 1 revolution (or traverses 2\\pi radians) relative to the disc.

{"question": "Explain with illustrations how data are read in (acquired) , writtenout (disposed of) and referred to in array structures.", "solution": "A matrix (i.e. a two dimensional array) is de-clared by the statement DCL X [9, 9] FIXEDDECIMAL(4); Now if a problem requires that the values of the main diagon-al of the matrixbe read in, there are two techniques for doing it.i) Use of a single getstatement of the form given below: GET LIST(X(1,1), X(2,2), X(3,3), X(4,4), X(5,5), X(6,6), X(7,7) , X(8,8) , X(9,9)) , or, ii) the iterative DO group illustrated below: DO I = 1 TO 9 BY 1; GET LIST X [I, I] ; END; The first method has the disadvantage that a long data specification is required. The second method is short and flexible. One of the ways to acquire data for one dimensionalarraysis as follows: GETLIST(N); DO I = 1 TO N BY 1; GETLIST(A(I)); END; If it is a two dimensional array then the following program segment can be used: GETLIST(M,N); DO I = 1 TO M; DO J = 1 TO N; GET LIST(X(I,J)); END; END; This method can be generalized to a multidimensional array: Take the upperbounds of all the dimensions. Then set DO loops with the most frequentlyvarying dimension at the in-nermost position and the least frequentlyvarying dimension at the outermost position. There is another technique provided by the PL/I machine, called repetitivedata specification, which reads in an en-tire array in just one GET statement. This is shown below: GETLIST(N, {X(I) DO I = 1 TO N}) ; Because of the left to right order, the variable N will be acquired beforeexecution of the DO-loop, where it is used as the upper limiting value. If it is a two dimensional array, for exampleX(10, 4) the statement willbe as follows: GETLIST((X (I, J) DO J = 1 TO 4) DO 1 = 1 TO 10); The repetitive specification consists of the following: a)thedata item to be used during execution of the DO portion (e.g., X(I) , Y(I,J)); b)thecontrol information which determines the number of times the dataitem is to be used for reading/writing values of the elements. (e.g. DO 1 = 1 TO N BY 1); c)apair of parentheses that enclose the repetitive specification. Similarly, to write out (dispose of) array elements, the repetitive dataspecification can also be used e.g., DECLARE (A,B)(10) FLOAT DECIMAL(5); PUTLIST[{B(I), A(I) DO I=1 TO 10}] SKIP; The value ofB(1) is printed out first, followed by A(1) , and then a line is skipped. After testing the limiting con-dition, iteration continues and outputs B(2), A(2) and so on. e.g.,DCL (A(100,4), B (100)) FIXED BIT(8); PUT DATA( (B(J) , (A(J,K) DO K = 1 TO 4) DO J=1 TO 100)); The put statement produces an output stream as follows: B(1) =XXXA(1,1) =XXXA(1,2) =XXXA(1,3) =XXXA(1,4) =XXX B(2) =XXXA(2,1) =XXXA(2,2) =XXXA(2,3) =XXXA(2,4) =XXX \\textbullet\\textbullet\\textbullet\\textbullet\\textbullet \\textbullet\\textbullet\\textbullet\\textbullet\\textbullet \\textbullet\\textbullet\\textbullet\\textbullet\\textbullet To refer to an element of array the following is done: a) A subscripted reference, also termed a subscripted name, is used. b) The subscript list must contain as many subscripts as there are dimensionsdeclared for the array. c) A subscripted reference consists of the name of the array followedby a list of one or more subscripts enclosed in parentheses. d) The integer value resulting from a subscript evalu-ation must fall withinthe bounds declared by the correspond-ing boundary specification. To understand clearly the above rules of referring to an element of anarray, consider the example given below: DECLARE A(10,10) FIXED DECIMAL(10,2), B(-1:5,-5:0,10:98) The subscript references A(3,5) A(1,2\u00d75 - 2) B(2,- 3,40) B[- (- 6 + 3),0,90] areall well formed and valid. Elements of the array A are referred by the arrayname A. Since A is a two dimensional array, the subscript reference hastwo subscripts and the in-teger value of the subscript is within the boundsdeclared for the array. So is the case for a reference made to arrayB. Now observe the following: The subscript references A(1,2,3) A(5) A(12,- 3) arenot valid. In the first case,A(1,2,3), there are three subscripts, alluding toa three dimensional array. But ar-ray A is declared as 2 dimensional. The same goes for the second case, but here, the subscript reference has onlyone dimension instead of the 2 which are required. In the third case, thereare two subscripts and array A is also of two di-mensions. However, boththe dimensions of array A have a lower bound of 1 and a higher boundof 10. Hence, 12, the first subscript element is greater than the higherbound, and - 3, the second subscript element is less than the lower bound1.

{"question": "A rope C helps to support a uniform 200-lb beam, 20 ft long, one end of which is hinged at the wall and the other end of which supports a 1.0-ton load. The rope makes an angle of 30\\textdegree with the beam, which is horizont-al. (a) Determine the tension in the rope, (b) Find the force F\\ding{217} at the hinge .", "solution": "Since all the known forces act on the 20-ft beam, let us consider it as the object in equilibrium. In addition to the 200- and 2000-lb forces straight down, there are the pull of the rope on the beam and the force F which the hinge exerts on the beam at the wall. Let us not make the mistake of assuming that the force at the hinge is straight up or straight along the beam. A little thought will convince us that the hinge must be pushing both up and out on the beam. The exact direction of this force, as well as its magnitude, is un-known. The second condition for equilibrium is an ex-cellent tool to employ in such a situation for if we use an axis through the point 0 as the axis about which to take torques, the unknown force at the hinge has zero moment arm and therefore, causes zero torque. The remark-able result is that we can determine the tension T in the rope without knowing either the magnitude or the direction of the force at 0. (a) The torques about an axis through O are (200 lb) (10 ft)= 2000 lb-ft counterclockwise (2000 lb)(20 ft)= 40,000 lb-ft counterclockwise The moment arm of T is OP = (20 ft)(sin 30\\textdegree) = 10 ft. Thus we have T (20 ft) sin 30\\textdegree= T(10 ft)clockwise Since the beam is in equilibrium, the torque about any point of the beam is zero. We can then say -T (10 ft) + 2000 lb-ft + 40,000 lb-ft + F(0 ft) = 0 orT = 4200 lb = 2.1 tons The trick just used in removing the unknown force from the problem by taking torques about the hinge as an axis is a standard device in statics. The student should always be on the lookout for the opportunity to sidestep (temporarily) a troublesome unknown force by selecting an axis of torques that lies on the line of action of the unknown force he wishes to avoid.

{"question": "An experimenter crossed a stock of corn homozygous for the linked recessive genes colorless (c), shrunken (s) and waxy (w) to a stock homozygous for the dominant alleles of these genes (C, S, W) and then backcrossed the F_1 plants to the homozygous recessive stock.

Let us first determine the parental type. We know that since the F_1 plants resulted from a cross between a homozygous dominant (CC, SS, WW) and a homozygous recessive (cc, ss, ww) parent, they are heterozygous (CcSsWw). They were crossed with homozygous recessive plants (ccssww) Therefore the parental types are CcSsWs ( 1 ) and ccssww ( 2 ). The other six phenotypes are recombinants. To determine the distances between the genes, let us determine the RF for two genes at a time. Consider a cross-over anywhere between c and S. The number or recombinants (from F_2) = 2009 3 + 2024 4 + 288 7 + 312 8 = 4633. RF = (4633) / (49400) = 0.094 An RF of 0.094 gives a separation of 9.4 units between C and S. Consider a cross-over between S and W. The number of recombinants = 4455 5 + 4654 6 + 288 7 + 312 8 = 9709. RF = (9709) / (49400) = 0.196 That is, S and W are 19.6 units apart. Consider a cross-over between C and Wx. The number of recombinants = 2009 3 + 2024 4 + 4455 5 + 4654 6 = 13142. RF = (13142) / (49400) = 0.266 That is, C and W are 26.6 map units apart. To construct a linkage map, we choose randomly C and Wx as our reference points. S is 19.6 units away from w. The only way s can be 9.4 units away from C is for s to lie between C and W. On a genetic map, we have: However, the sum of the map distances between C' and S, and between S and W = 9.4 + 19.6 or 29.0 unit. This sum is greater than the distance between C and W (26.6 units). How do we explain this discrepancy? The explanation lies in the fact that more than one cross-over can occur between two genes, expecially if they are far apart. In this case, there is a cross-over between C and S and between S and W making two cross-overs between C and Wx. Diagrammatically, this can be rep- resented as follows: The result of two cross-overs between two genes is called a double recombinant. Since single cross-overs are quite infrequent, the frequency of double recombinants is even lower. The double recombinants are usually identified by their lowest frequency in the F_2. From F_2, the number of double recombinants = 288 7 312 8 or 600. Percentage of = [(number of double cross-over)/(total number of progeny) \u00d7 100 = [(600)/(49400)] \u00d7 100 = 1.2% The cause of the discrepancy between the map distances can be traced to the fact that when we calculate the RF between C and S and between S and W, we include the number of double recombinants into the number of recombinants each time. (Refer to previous calculations). However, when we determine the RF between C and W, we neglect the double cross-overs because they do not affect the parental types CW and cw. To compensate for the double cross-overs, we have to add to the map distance between C and W twice the perc.entage of double cross- overs. This is because each double cross-over is the result of two separate events, a cross between c and S and a cross between S and W. In essence, four more crosses have occured between c and w that had not been considered before, having a total frequency of: (288)/(49400) (between c and s)(288)/(49400)(between s and w) (312)/(+49400) (between c and s)(312)/(+49400) (between c and w) or 2 \u00d7 1. 2. Thus the distance between c and w is 26.6 + (2 \u00d7 1.2) or 29.0 units. After the correction is made, everything falls in place. Note that the recombination frequency between each pair of genes is increased by the frequency of the double cross-overs.", "images": ["images/F25-0679_files/image002.jpg", "images/F25-0679_files/image004.jpg", "images/F25-0679_files/image006.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F25-0679.htm", "image_question": true, "image_answer": true, "short_answer": false, "answer": "C and S are 9.4 units apart, S and W are 19.6 units apart, C and W are 26.6 map units apart"}
{"question": "Discuss various types of computer systems in terms of the level of expense, sophistication, and capabilities to carry out intended commercial and scientific data processing tasks.", "solution": "Traditionally, the computer systems from lowest to highest level of capabilities have been classified as: Microcom-puters, Minicomputers, and Mainframes. It used to be that micros such as INTEL 8085 had 8-bit registers, minis such as PDP-11 had 16-bit registers, and mainframes such as IBM 370 had 32-bit registers. Note that the amount of addressable Random Access Memory (RAM) is dependent upon the register length. Accordingly, micros had small, minis had larger, and mainframes had much larger memories. Although the above classification still serves a useful purpose for quick sizing and comparisons, the rapid developments in VLSI technologies for fourth generation computers have blurred these distinctions. There have also been many grades and shades in between this family of computers. Generally, the mi-crocomputers have caught up with mainframes in terms of process-ing speeds and memory capacities, but the mainframes still re-tain the edge in terms of secondary storage, communication, and I/O peripherals.

A vehicle moves according to Newton's third law of motion: Every action has an equal but opposite re-action. The wheels of a car exert a force on the road in the backward direction. The reaction force is the force which acts in the direction opposite to the friction on the wheels, pushing the car forward. There is a maximum reaction force that the road can exert on the wheels, limited by the coefficient of friction which depends on the smoothness of the road, and by the weight of the car. This maximum thrust which the frictional force can exert on the car, limits its maximum accelera-tion.

{"question": "Compare the processes of digestion in the hydra, flatworm and earthworm.", "solution": "Hydra is a member of the coelenterate phylum. Hydra is a multicellular, sac-like organism whose body wall is two cells thick. Many of the cells are semi-specialized, differing in function from their immediate neighbors. The hydra's digestive system, the gastrovascular cavity, has only one opening-the mouth (refer to Figure 1) . The tenta-cles of the hydra have special cells, called nematocysts, that spear tiny organisms swimming near the hydra. The ten-tacles then draw the prey into the mouth. The cells lining the gastrovascular cavity begin digestion by secreting en-zymes. This mode of digestion, occuring outside cells, is extracellular digestion. Extracellular digestion is followed by intracellular digestion in the hydra. When small food fragments come into contact with the cells lining the cavities, these fragments are phagocytized and digestion is completed inside the cell. The indigestible material is expelled through the mouth. Thus, the hydra utilizes extracellular digestion to break down relatively large organisms into small pieces which are then digested intracellularly by individual cells. Flatworms are small animals that are often parasitic. Parasitic flatworms have lost most of their ability to procure food and are provided with nutrients by their host. However, some flatworms such as planaria are non-parasitic and are free-living organisms. The mouth of the planaria is on the ventral side, in the middle of the body (refer to Figure 2). It opens into a tubular muscular pharynx that can protrude through the mouth directly onto the prey. The pharynx opens into a gastrovascular cavity similar to those other coelenterates but much more branched. The extensive branching brings nutrients to all parts of the body and helps increase the absorptive surface area of the cavity. Some extracellular digestion occurs in the cavity but most food is phagocytized and digested intracellularly in the cells lining the cavity. An earthworm has a complete digestive tract. It has two openings, the mouth and anus, (refer to Figure 3), with wastes expelled through the anus and food ingested through the mouth. Various regions of the tract are specialized: the pharynx to suck in food, the esophagus to transport food to the crop, the crop to store the food, the gizzard to break the food up, and the intestine to digest and absorb the food. Most digestion is extracellular, utilizing the enzymes secreted by cells lining the tract. The digestive tract is not widely branched, but is rather like a simple gastrovascular cavity. However, large numbers of folds are found in the tract lining, which greatly increase the absorptive surface area. Since the earthworm is a land animal, it must also conserve its body fluids by reabsorbing water from the indigestible wastes. This occurs in the posterior region of the intestine, analogous to the human large intestine.", "images": ["images/F17-0419_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F17-0419.htm", "image_question": true, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Hydra utilizes extracellular digestion to break down relatively large organisms into small pieces which are then digested intracellularly by individual cells.

{"question": "What is behavior? Are behavior patterns solely inherited or canthey be modified?", "solution": "The term behavior refers to the patterns by which organisms surviveand reproduce. The more an organism must actively search the environmentto maintain life, the more advanced are its behavior patterns. Thus a deer shows more complex behavior patterns than does aplanaria. However, even sedentary organisms such as sea coral display forms of behaviornecessary for survival. Behavior is not limited to the animal kingdom; plants display simple behavior, such as the capture of prey by thevenusflytrap. Behavior has a genetic or hereditary basis that is controlled by an organism'sDNA. The anatomical aspects of both the nervous and endocrinesystems are chiefly determined by the genetic composition. These two systems are responsible for most behavioralpheneomena. In general, an organisms 's behavior is principally an ex-pression of the capabilitiesof its nervous system, modi-fied to various extents by its endocrinesystem. Behavioral development is often influenced by experience. This modificationof behavioral patterns through an organism's particular experiencesis called learning. For example, some birds transmit their species-specificsong to their offspring solely by heredity, while others, suchas the chaffinch, must experience the singing of the song by other chaffinchesin order for them to acquire the song. Bothinheritanceandlearning are therefore fun-damental in the determinationof behavioral patterns. Inheritance determines the limits withinwhich a pattern can be modified.

{"question": "What is paleontology? List the various kinds ofpaleontologic evidence. Why is it that fossils are frequently difficult to find?", "solution": "Paleontology is the science of the finding, cataloguing and interpretationof the abundant and diverse evidence of life in ancient times. Fossils are the most important tools of the paleontologist in studying the past. Fossils can be bones, shells, teeth, and other hard parts of an animalor plant body which have been preserved, and indeed, include any impressionor trace left by some previous organism. As such they constitutethepaleontologicevidence of evolution. Most of the vertebrate fossils found are skeletal parts. From these partspaleontologists can infer the contours of the body, the posture, and thestyle of walking of the ancient animal. Using this information, recon-structionscan be made showing how the animal may have looked in life. Footprints or trails are another type of fossil. These are made by the animalin soft mud, which subsequently hardened. They enable one to inferthe size, body proportion, structures, and style of walking of the animalthat made them. Tools made by early man are also important artifacts. They aid in the determination of how and whenbipedalism evolved(hands had to be free in order to use tools). The discovery of tools alsoserves as invaluable information, providing clues of early man's culture, and can even be used to infer the origin of language. Petrified fossils result from the replacement by minerals of the originalanimal or plant material. The minerals that replace the once living tissuesmay be iron pyrites: silica, calcium carbonate or a variety of other substances. Petrifaction has been shown to be an effective type of preservationfor tissues as old as 300,000,000 years. Molds are still anothertype of fossil, and are formed by the hardening of the material surroundingthe buried organism, followed by the decay and removal of theorganism by ground water. Sometimes the molds became accidentally filledwith minerals, which then hardened to form casts or replicas of the originalorganism. In the far north, frozen fossils of whole animal bodies have been foundin the ground or ice. Old forms of plants, insects and spiders have beenfound preserved in amber, a fossil resin from pine trees. The resin wasat first a soft sap engulfing the fragile insect; then it slowly hardened, preservingthe insect intact. Usually, then, the formation and preservation of a fossil follows the buryingof some structure or entire organism. This may occur at the bottomof a deep body of water, or on land hidden deep in the earth's crust. Generally, fossils are preserved in areas that are well hidden or hardto reach. This is because fossils under shallow water or near the earth'ssurface are usually destroyed due to constant disturbances from naturalforces, such as wind and rain, and from living organisms. Therefore, fossils are generally well concealed and difficult to find.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F28-0730.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Paleontology is the science of the finding, cataloguing and interpretation of the abundant and diverse evidence of life in ancient times.

{"question": "Explain why the stomata of a leaf tend to open up during the day and to close at night. What advantage is there in this?", "solution": "During the day, the plant undergoes photosynthesis, a process which converts carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates.This results in a drop of the carbon dioxide content of the cell as carbon dioxide is used up. When this happens, the acidity of the cell decreases, promoting the conversion of the insoluble starch to the soluble glucose. This can be explained by the fact that the cellular enzymes that catalyze the conversion of starch to glucose do not function in acidic surroundings. During the night hours, production of carbon dioxide occurs during respiration . In addition, no carbon dioxide is depleted by photosynthe-sis which occurs only during the day. This results in a high carbon dioxide level in the cells. When its levels are high, carbon dioxide will combine with water to form carbonic acid. This will inhibit the conversion of starch to sugar, due to a decrease in thepH.When the carbon dioxide level in the cell is as low as it is during the daytime when photosynthesis occurs, much of the carbonic acid is reconverted to carbon dioxide and water, increasing the alkalinity of the cell and thus raising thepH.The greater alkalinity of the plant cells during the day brings about a higher cellular glucose concentration with the reverse true at night. During the day, the high cellular concentration of glucose causes water to enter the guard cells by osmosis, rendering them turgid. The turgor of the guard cells cause them to bend, opening the stoma as a result . At night, the acidity of the cell inhibits the break-down of starch. Since starch is insoluble in the cell sap, it does not exert an osmotic pressure. In the ab-sence of osmotic pressure, the guard cells lose theirturgor, causing them to collapse and close the stoma. What then is the purpose of having the stoma open in the day and closed at night? In the daytime, when the leaves are photosynthesizing, the carbon dioxide supply in the cell is constantly being depleted and its supply must be replenished in order to maintain photosynthe-sis. Thus it is highly advantageous to have the stomata open during the day, in order for carbon dioxide mole-cules to enter the leaf from the atmosphere through the stomata. Open stomata also result in continuous transpiration, hence the air spaces of the leaf are al-ways kept moist for carbon dioxide to dissolve in. This is important since carbon dioxide must first dissolve in water before it can enter the cell. At night when photosynthesis ceases, an external supply of carbon dioxide is not required.

{"question": "Find the distance between a plane passing through the centers of one close-packed layer of spheres and an-other plane passing through the centers of an adjacent close- packed layer. You may assume that all spheres are identical with a radius of .200 nm.", "solution": "The small fraction of a space lattice, which is the pattern of points that describes the arrangement of atoms or molecules in a crystal, is a unit cell. The unit cells contain only points that locate atomic or molecular centers. since atoms are space-filling entities, their structures can be described as resulting from the packing together of representative spheres. The most efficient packing together of equal spheres is called closest packing. In this problem, you are asked for a distance between two planes, which is just the spacing between the layers of spheres. A face- centered cube, a type of unit cell, is a close packed structure. From the accompanying figure, you can see that the body diagonal of a face- centered cube is perpendicular to the close-packed stacking layers. Thus, if you stand it on a corner, the close packed layers will be parallel to the floor. To see this more clearly, you can use models. From this, you can relate the body diagonal to the spacing between layers. Namely, body diagonal = 3 times the spacing. Thus, you need to find the length of the body diagonal.

{"question": "What is the difference between a kinesis and a taxis?", "solution": "Bothkinesesand taxes are types of animal orientation. Orientation is the process by which the animal directs theconsummatoryact at an appropriate object (the goal). It is involved in those forms of appetitive behavior in which the animal moves in a constant direction in search of a goal. Highly developed forms of orientation are involved in the migration and homing behavior of birds.Kinesesand taxes are two simpler forms of orientation. A kinesis is a form of orientation in which the animal does not necessarily direct its body toward the stimulus. The stimulus merely causes the animal to speed or slow down its movements, resulting in the eventual displacement of the animal toward or away from the stimulus. It is an undirected type of orientation. The movement of the woodlouse is a good example of a kinesis. A woodlouse is a crustacean that lives in damp environments beneath stones or pieces of wood. When the woodlouse finds itself dehydrating, it begins to move around. This increase in locomotoractivity may cause the woodlouse to chance upon a moist spot. Here, the dampness causes the woodlouse to slow down and it now establishes a new home. The woodlouse did not direct itself toward the moist spot, but simply encountered it by random movement. In contrast, a taxis is a type of orientation in which the animal directs its body toward or away from the stimulus. The type of stimulus is usually denoted by a prefix to the word taxis: a geotaxis is movement regulated by gravity; aphototaxisis movement guided by light; a chemotaxisis movement guided by chemical substances. Movement toward the stimulus is a positive taxis whereas movement away from the stimulus is a negative taxis. For example, the directed movement of cockroaches away from light is termed negativephototaxis. Another common example of a taxis is the directed movement of the bee flying to its hive or source of pollen. The bee maintains a straight course by moving at a constant angle to the sun, therefore exhibiting aphototaxis. The term taxis should be distinguished from tropism: Tropism indicates growth of an organism in a particular direction.

{"question": "Describe the hormonal interactions that control the development and functioning of the breasts.", "solution": "Perhaps no other process so clearly demonstrates the intricate interplay of various hormonal control mechanisms as milk production. The breasts are composed of numerous ducts which branch through the breast tissue and converge at the nipples. These ducts terminate at their other end within the breast, in saclike structures (alveoli) typical of exocrine glands. It should be noted that an exocrine gland, by definition, secretes material into ducts leading to a specific compartment or surface. The alveoli are the actual milk secreting structures. Both the alveoli and the ducts are lined by contractile cells whose role will be eludicated later. Before puberty, the breasts are small with little internal structure. With the onset of puberty, estrogen and progesterone act upon the ductiletissue and alveoli to produce the basic architecture of the adult breast. In addition to these two hormones, normal breast development at puberty requires prolactin and growth hormone, both secreted by the anterior pituitary. During each menstrual cycle, the morphology of the breast changes in response to fluctuating blood concentra-tions of estrogen and progesterone. The greatest change in breast morphology occurs, however, during pregnancy. The most important hormone which promotes milk production is prolactin. But the onset of lactation requires more than just high prolactin levels. This is seen in that the level of prolactin is elevated and the breasts are enlarged as pregnancy progresses, and yet there is no secretion of milk. The question arises as to what occurs during delivery to permit the onset of lactation. There have been numerous experiments performed with different mammals, which has shown that if the fetus is removed during pregnancy without interfering with the placenta, lactation will not be induced; when the placenta is removed at any stage of the pregnancy, without removal of the fetus, lactation is induced. Present evidence indicates that this inhibitory effect of the placenta is due to its secretion of estrogen and progesterone, which in large concentration appears to inhibit miik release by some direct action on the breasts. Therefore, delivery removes the source of the two hormones, and thereby removes the inhibition to allow lactation to occur. The hypothalamus also influences lactation. The hypo-thalamus releases a Prolactin Inhibitory Factor. This chemi-cal is decreased during suckling; thus increased prolactin allows secretion of milk to occur. While it is still unclear as to what stimulates increased prolactin secretion during pregnancy, it is known what the major factor is in maintaining thesecretion during lactation. It is believed that receptors in the nipples, which are stimulated by suckling, have nervous inputs to the hypothalamus. These inputs ultimately cause prolactin to be released from the anterior pituitary. One final reflex is essential for nursing. The infant cannot suckle milk out of the alveoli where it is produced, but can only remove milk that is present in the ducts. Milk must first move out of the alveoli into the ducts, a process known as milk let-down. This is accomplished by contraction of the contractile cells surrounding the alveoli. The contraction of these cells is under the direct control of the posterior pituitary hormone oxytocin. This hormone is reflexively released by suckling just like prolactin.Oxytocin is also responsible for the contraction of the uterine muscles during delivery, and it is for this reason that many women experience uterine contractions during nursing. Another important neuroendocrine reflex triggered by suckling is the inhibition of follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone released by the pituitary. Low levels of FSH and LH subsequently prevent ovulation. This inhibition is relatively short-lived in many women, and approximately 50 per cent begin to ovulate despite continued nursing. The end product of all these processes is the milk which contains four major constituents: water, protein, fat, and the carbohydrate lactose.

These hormones act upon the ductile tissue and alveoli to produce the basic architecture of the adult breast. During pregnancy, the most important hormone which promotes milk production is prolactin. The onset of lactation requires more than just high prolactin levels. The hypothalamus also influences lactation by releasing a Prolactin Inhibitory Factor. The contraction of the contractile cells surrounding the alveoli, a process known as milk let-down, is under the direct control of the posterior pituitary hormone oxytocin."}
{"question": "What arrangement of the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in a five- element array will yield the longest sort time (also known as the worst-case sort time) for the insertion sort? Gen-eralize the answer you obtain for N integers.", "solution": "As developed earlier, in the insertion sort method, the list is scanned until an element is found to be out of order. The unordered element is stored temporarily, and the scan reverses direction until it reaches the place where the unordered element should be. The rest of the list's elements are moved up one place, and the sort continues. If the list of integers is presented initially in re-verse order, the insertion sort will have to make the great-est number of comparisons.

We can generalize from this result to obtain a worst-case equation for the insertion sort. The maximum number of comparisons for the insertion sort is N (N - 1) / 2 This can be seen by writing the series in the order given and in the reverse order: (N - 1) + (N - 2) + (N - 3) + . . . + 3 + 2 + 1 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + (N - 3) + (N - 2) + (N - 1) Adding term by term, we find that twice the sum of the series is N + N + N + ... + N + N + N Since N-l terms are in the series above, we can say that twice the sum of the series is N (N - 1), so, dividing by 2, the sum of the series is N (N -1) / 2.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G07-0147.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "Reverse order"}

{"question": "The gene for PKU is found in the heterozygous state in about one person in fifty. About how frequently would you expect babies to be born with PKU? Assume here that the homozygous state for PKU is either lethal or severely restricts the affected person's ability to produce offspring.", "solution": "The trait for PKU disease is recessive, and thus the genotype of babies born with the disease must be homozygous recessive. This genotype could be produced through the mating of two phenotypically normal people who are heterozygous for the PKU gene. The chance that two such heterozygotes will marry can be determined by using simple probability procedures. We know that the probability of two separate events occurring together is the product of their separate probabilities. If the heterozygous genotype occurs in one person out of fifty, then the chance that any two people who marry will both be carriers is 1/50 \u00d7 1/50 or 1/2,500 and only one marriage out of 2,500 will be capable of producing children with PKU.

The cross between two Pp individuals is illustrated below: P The offspring are obtained in the ratio: 1/4 PP : 1/2 Pp : 1/4 pp We see that only one child in four will be homozygous recessive for the PKU allele, and consequently have the disease.

{"question": "What is the equivalent capacitance between the points A and B in diagram (A)? The charge on the 6-\\muF capacitor is 90 \\muC. What potential difference exists between the points A and R?", "solution": "In the arrangement shown in diagram (A) there are two sets of capacitors in parallel. Since the net capacitance of n capacitors in parallel is C_net = C_1, + C_2 + . . . + C_n the arrangement is equivalent to that shown in diagram (B). In each branch there are now two capacitors in series. If we have n capacitors in series, their net capacitance is (1/C_net) = (1/C_1) + (1/C_2) + . . . + (1/C_n) For each branch, then, (1/C_net) = (1/C_1) + (1/C_2). For the top branch (1/C_net ) = (1/12 \\muF) + (1/4 \\muF) = [(4 \\muF + 12 \\muF)/(48 \\muF^2 )] C_net = 3 \\muF For the lower branch (1/C_net ) = (1/4 \\muF) + (1/2 \\muF) = [(2 \\muF + 4 \\muF)/(8 \\muF^2 )] C_net = (4/3) \\muF Thus, the arrangement is equivalent to that shown in diagram (C). Here we have two capacitors in parallel. Their capacitances add. Hence, the equivalent capacitance between A and B is C = [3 + (4/3)] \\muF = 4 (1/3) \\muF. The charge on the 6-\\muF capacitor is 90 \\muC. Hence, the potential across it is, by definition of capacitance V_DS = [(Q_DS )/(C_DS )] = [(90 \u00d7 10^-6 C)/(6 \u00d7 10^-6 F)] = 15 V. This potential is common to all the capacitors in the top branch between A and S since they are all in parallel. Hence the total charge on the equivalent 12-\\muF capacitor is Q_AS = C_AS V_AS = C_AS V_DS = 12 \u00d7 10^-6 F \u00d7 15 V = 180 \\muC. The conductors connected to S are isolated and initially must have been uncharged. If a charge of - 180 \\muC appears on the negative plate of the equivalent 12-\\muF capacitor connected to S, a corresponding charge of + 180 \\muC must be induced on the positive plate of the 4-\\muF capacitor connected to S, leaving the net charge at S zero. A corresponding - 180-\\muC charge is induced on the negative terminal of the 4- \\muF capacitor, and the voltage between its plates is thus V_SB = (Q_SB /C_SB ) = [(180 \u00d7 10^-6 C)/(4 \u00d7 10^-6 F)] = 45 V. The total potential difference between A and B is thus V = V_AS + V_SB = (15 + 45) V = 60 V. This is the potential difference between A and B by either branch. Referring to diagram (C), the charge on the equivalent 4/3-\\muF capacitor is thus Q_AE = C_AE V_AE = C_AE V = (4/3) \u00d7 10^-6 F \u00d7 60 V = 80 \\muC. This is the charge on the plate attached to A in either the equivalent circuit or the original circuit, since the two produce identical effects. Hence the equivalent 4-\\muF capacitor between A and R has charges of \\pm 80 \\muC on each of its plates.

{"question": "There are twelve pairs of cranial nerves in man. Give the type(s) of fibers found in each and briefly discuss the function(s) of each of them.", "solution": "Cranial nerves leave the brain at different regions and serve different functions. They connect the brain to variouseffectororgans, primarily the sense organs, muscles and glands of the head. Some cranial nerves contain only motor fibers, some contain only sensory fibers, and some contain both types of fibers. In addition, some are composed of parasym-pathetic fibers (which are exclusively motor), the action of which is involuntary. There are twelve pairs of cranial nerves in man. The olfactory nerve (cranial nerve I) is composed en-tirely of afferent fibers carrying impulses for the sense of smell from the olfactory epithelium to the base of the brain. The optic nerve (II) is also entirely sensory and contains afferent fibers running from the retina to the visual center of the brain. The occulomotor (III) andtrochlear(IV) nerves both have afferent and efferent branches which connect the midbrain to the muscles of the eye. Together they are responsible forproprioceptionof the eye muscles, movement of the eyeball,accomodationof the eye, and constriction of the pupil. The trigeminal nerve (V) contains both afferent and efferent fibers running between theponsand the face and jaws. It functions mainly in stimulating movement of the muscles of the jaws involved in chewing. The fibers of theabducensnerve (VI) run between theponsand muscles of the eye. This nerve conveys the sense of position of the eyeball to the brain, and aids the III and IV nerves in effecting mo-vement of the eyeball. The facial nerve (VII) has both afferent and efferent fibers that innervate muscles of the face, mouth, forehead and scalp. It also functions in the transmission of impulses for the sense of taste from the anterior part of the tongue to the brain. The fibers of the auditory nerve orvestibulocochlear(VIII) exclusively afferent, run from the inner ear to the junction of theponsand medulla. These fibers convey the senses of hearing and equilibrium (movement, balance and rotation) to the appropriate centers in the brain. Connecting the medulla to the epithelium and muscles of the pharynx, and to the salivary gland and tongue are the fibers of theglossophar-yngeal nerve (IX) This nerve is responsible for the sense of taste from the posterior part of the tongue and from the lining of the larynx. It is also responsible for the reflex-ive act of swallowing. The tenth cranial nerve, the vagus , has both sensory and motor branches, but the motor fibers are parasympathetic autonomic fibers and thus their action is involuntary. Its sensory fibers originate in many of the internal organs - lungs, stomach, aorta, larynx, to name a few - and its motor (parasympathetic) fibers run to the heart, stomach, small intestine, larynx and esophagus. Be-sides the vagus , the III, VII, and IX nerves also contain parasympathetic fibers, but in smaller amounts. The efferent and afferent branches of the accessory nerve (XI) connect the medulla to the pharynx and larynx and muscles of the shoulder, which they innervate. Afferent fibers of the last cranial nerve, the hypoglossal, convey the sense ofproprio-ceptionfrom the tongue to the medulla, and the efferent fibers stimulate movement of the tongue. The cranial nerves are numberedanteriorlytoposteri-orly. I and II originate in the olfactory epithelium and retina respectively.

{"question": "What velocity must a rocket be given so that it escapes the gravitational field of the earth?", "solution": "In order to escape the earth's gravitational field, the rocket must travel an infinite distance from the earth. The change in potential energy, \u2206V, of the rocket as it goes from the earth's surface to infinity is \u2206V =GM_Em_R[1/R_E - 1/r] =GM_Em_R[1/R_E - 1/\\infty] = (GM_Em_R)/(R_E). The gravitational acceleration at the surface of the earth is written as g = (GM_E)/(R^2_E) = 9.8 m/sec^2. Rewriting \u2206V so that g appears in the expression, we have \u2206V = (GM_E)/(R^2_E) \u00d7R_Em_R=gR_Em_R. This is the potential energy that the rocket must acquire if it is to escape the earth's pull. This energy comes from the conversion of kinetic energy to potential energy. There-fore the initial kinetic energy given to the rocket must at least equal, this change in potential energy.

{"question": "What is the evidence that the chemical compounds of a cell arein a \"dynamic state\"?", "solution": "The term \"dynamic state\" is meant to indicate that the chemical compoundsof a cell are cons-tantly being broken down and synthesized.

That is, the cellular compounds are stable and remain inthe cell for long periods of time without being degraded and replaced, theonly exception being those compounds used as \"fuel\" for energy, whichby necessity must undergo catabolism. However, experimental evidence has shown that this belief in the staticstate of the cell's compounds is false. The cell's compounds are constantlychanging - being broken down and replaced by newly synthesizedcompounds. Radio- activelylabelledamino acids, fats, and carbohydratescan be injected into laboratory animals in order to demonstratethe dynamic nature of the cell's environment. If the cell were static, thelabelledmolecules would only be broken down for fuel. However, it has been observed that thelabelledamino acids are incorporatedinto proteins and that thelabelledfatty acids into fats(triglycerides). The marked proteins and fats are then degraded by the bodyto be replaced by the incorporation of new amino acids and fatty acids. All these metabolic processes occur without any visible change in bodysize. The only exception to the dynamic state of the cell is its DNA molecules, which contain genes, the body's basic units of genetic infor-mation. DNA is extremely stable in order that the here-ditary characteristics, for which it codes, have little or no chance of changing.

{"question": "Differentiate between acids, bases and salts.

In the Lowry- Bronsted definition, an acid is a compound with the capacity to donate a proton, and a base is a compound with the capacity to accept a proton. In the Lewis definition, an acid has the ability to accept an electron pair and a base the ability to donate an electron pair. Salts are a group of chemical substances which generally consist of positive and negative ions arranged to maximize attractive forces and minimize repulsive forces. Salts can be either inorganic or organic. For example, sodium chloride, NaCl, is an inorganic salt which is actually best represented with its charges Na^+ Cl^-; sodium acetate, CH_3COONa or CH_3COO^-Na^+ is an organic salt. Some common acids important to the biological system are acetic acid (CH_3 COOH), carbonic acid (H_2 CO_3), phosphoric acid (H_3 PO_4), and water. Amino acids, the building blocks of protein, are compounds that contain an acidic group (-COOH). Some common bases are ammonia (NH_3), pyridine (C_5H_5N), purineand water. The nitro-genous bases important in the structure of DNA and RNA carry the purine or pyridine functional group.

The concept of refinement is used here, because there are many subtasks that must be accomplished throughout. The first flowchart to be written is only a skeleton of the entire algorithm and is shown in figure 1. We Include annotation nodes where the subsequent flowcharts should fit in. Let us call the six input items A, B, C, D, E, and F. Assume that the two dates are June 1, 1978 and May 15, 1979. Then, A, B, and C are 06, 01 and 78 respectively and D, E, and F are 05,15 and 79 respectively. To find intervening days in a single month, control passes to the box containing T \\leftarrow T + (E - B). To find longer periods of time, you must write more complicated instructions. First, let us examine node 7. This section evaluates the number of days in the month given. February is set aside until we have to adjust for leap years. The flowchart for node 7 is given in figure 2. This section checks the data for all types of errors. The variable KMT is used in the error messages to indicate that the KNTth card is wrong. FLAG remains at zero until both pairs of dates, (A and B, D and E) are checked on each card. X and Y store the dates temporarily while error testing is done. The following relations are checked; if there is an error, a message is output. 1) No month code can be greater than 12. 2) If the month code is 4, 6, 9, or 11 (April, June, September, or November), a maximum of 30 days is allowed. 3) If the month is neither February nor one of the above, it must have a maximum of 31 days. The flag must be raised to 1 before control passes to the next card. When the next pair of dates is examined through the flowchart, KNT is increased by 1, and the main program continues. Node 3 rearranges the dates if the first group ABC follows DEF on the calendar. Year, month, and day are evaluated in that order, and appropriate action is taken. The flowchart for node 3 is given in figure 3. Node 5 calculates the number of days if the dates are not in the same year. Leap years are taken into account by adding 366 days to the elapsed time. Further refinements for the elapsed months and days will come in node 6. The flowchart for node 5 is shown in figure 4. To explain the next node, we must first introduce the following data table. It gives the month codes, the elapsed days in a year starting with the first of each month(s), the days remaining in a year starting with the last day of each month (W), and the number of days in each month (Z). For leap years, the entries in the table are adjusted in the program. The table is shown in figure 5 and the flowchart in figure 6.

{"question": "One electron is removed from O_2 and one from N_2. The bonding in O_2 is strengthened, while the bonding in N_2 is weakened. 1) Explain these findings, and 2) predict what happens if an electron is removed from NO.", "solution": "There are two types of molecular orbitals: bonding and antibonding. A chemical bond is strengthened by electrons in bonding orbitals and weakened by electrons in antibonding orbitals. For every bonding orbital, there is a corresponding antibonding orbital. Each orbital can hold 2 electrons. Bond order measures bond strength by giving an indication of the number of electrons in bonding versus antibonding orbitals. Bond order is defined as one half the number of electrons in the bonding orbital less one half the number of electrons in the antibonding orbital. Thus, the higher the bond order, the stronger the bond. To find the original bond order, consider the valence electrons, the outermost electrons, since they are the only ones that participate in bonding. For N, Z = 7. Its electron configuration is 1s^2 2s^2 2p^3. The outer-most electrons are in 2p^3. This means that in N^2 there are a total of six valence electrons. There exist 3 bonding p orbitals. They can accommodate the six valence electrons. Since no electrons need be in antibonding orbitals, bond order = (1/2) (6) - (1/2) (0) = 3. When an electron is removed, the bonding orbitals have only 5 electrons. Thus, the bond order becomes (1/2) (5) - (1/2) (0) = 2.5. Since the bond order went from 3 to 2.5, the bond is weakened by removing the electron from N_2. For O, Z = 8. Since its electron configuration is 1s^2 2s^2 2p^4, each O atom has 4 valence electrons. O_2 has a total of 8 valence electrons. The three bonding p orbitals can hold only 6 .of these electrons. Thus, two electrons are in antibonding orbitals. The bond order is (1/2) (6) - (1/2) (2) = 2. When one removes an electron, it is removed from the antibonding orbitals, if electrons exist in such orbitals. Therefore, the O_2, after removal of the electron, has only 1 electron in an antibonding electron. This means the bond order becomes (1/2) (6) - (1/2) (1) = 2.5. The bond increased from 2 to 2.5, which means that bond strength increases when one removes an electron from O_2. To predict what happens to NO bond strength, consider the bond order before and after the electron removal. Recall, an O atom has 4 valence electrons and N has 3 valence electrons. The total in NO is seven. The 3 p bonding orbit-als can hold six of these electrons. This means 1 electron is in on antibonding orbital. Bond order = (1/2) (6) - (1/2) (1) = 2.5. If one removes one electron, the antibonding orbitals contain zero electrons. Thus, the bond order becomes (1/2) (6) - (1/2) (0) = 3. The bond increased from 2.5 to 3, which means the bond strength increases. Therefore, one can pre-dict the chemical bond strength of NO increases when an electron is removed.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E18-0661.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The chemical bond strength of NO increases when an electron is removed."}

The differential mass element dm, shown as the dotted ring in the figure, has area 2\\pir dr.

{"question": "High levels of progesterone are essential for the maintenance of the uterine lining during pregnancy. But high levels of progesterone exerts a negative feedback action on LH secretion, with a consequent decrease in LH secretion and eventual atrophy of the corpus luteum. Atrophy of the corpus luteum cuts the progesterone supply resulting in menstruation. Clearly, these events cannot take place after conception, or the embryo would get sloughed off. When conception occurs, the corpus luteum is seen to last through most of pregnancy. How can this be explained?", "solution": "It has been shown that the portion of the placenta called the chorion secretes a hormone, called chorionic gonadotrophin, that is functionally very similar to LH. The function of this hormone is to take the place of LH in preserving the corpus luteum, LH production being inhibited by a high progesterone level. The corpus luteum is then able to secrete progesterone at high levels without being shut off. The amount of this chorionic hormone produced in a pregnant woman is very great. A pregnant woman produces so much of this hormone that most of it is excreted in the urine. Many commonly used tests for pregnancy are based on this fact. One test involves the injection of the patient's urine into a test animal such as a rabbit. If chorionic hormone is in the urine, development of a corpus luteum within 24 hours will take place in the rabbit, and pregnancy can be confirmed. Although the corpus luteum is essential during early pregnancy and is present during most of pregnancy, it has been shown that it is no longer necessary after about the first two months. It seems that the placenta begins to secrete progesterone (and estrogen) early in pregnancy, and once this secretion has reached a sufficiently high level the placenta itself can maintain the pregnancy in the absence of the corpus luteum.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F21-0562.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The chorion of the placenta secretes a hormone, called chorionic gonadotrophin, that is functionally very similar to LH.

{"question": "Whatfunctionsare served by sound communication in animals?", "solution": "Communication by sound can convey a variety of messages necessaryto the survival and reproduction of the participants. Sound communicationis of special interest to us as humans because it serves as thefun-damental basis of our language. Other species use forms of auditorylanguage, although not nearly as complex or sophisticated as humanspeech. Mate attraction, species recognition, defense, and territorialclaim are examples of functions of sound communication in animals. The femaleAedesmosquito creates a buzzing sound with her wings, which serves to attract the male mosquito. The sound waves cause themale's antennae to vibrate, stimulating sensory hairs. This allows the maleto locate the female and copulate with her. An interesting adap-tation forthis communication is that in the sexually immature male mosquito, the antennaehairs lie close to the antenna shaft, causing near deafness. This preventssexually immature males from responding to females. When the malemosquito reaches maturity, the antennae hairs become erect, allowinghim to be receptive to the female's characteristic mating sound. The frequency of the buzzing sound is specific for each species of mosquito; thus, sexually mature males will respond only to females of their ownspecies. The mating calls of frogs are also species-specific. In contrastto theAedesmosquito, however, it is the male frog that attracts thefemale by calling. Bird songs are a good example of sound communication being usedfor territorial defense and species recognition. A territory may be definedas, the area defended by an animal. This area centers around the animal'sbreeding ground, nest site, and sources of food or other needs. The use of sound to defend a territory is exemplified in the following experiment. If silent models of wood thrushes are set up within the territoryof a given thrush, they would be attacked by that thrush. If, however, a loudspeaker is set up next to the models, and the char-acteristicspeciessong of another species played, the thrush will not attack. This is because males attack only other males of their own species, since they are the most threatening to their territories. Singing also plays a role in the establishment of territories. A male birdchooses an area and sings loudly in order to warn away other males. During the spring, when boundaries are being established, the male thrushesthat sing most loudly and forcefully are those who successfully acquire the largest territories.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F31-0799.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Mate attraction, species recognition, defense, and territorial claim are examples of functions of sound communication in animals."}

How many moles are possible with 4.5 g of water?", "solution": "If you had the general equation, aA+bB\\rightarrowcC+dD, a moles of A react with b moles of B to produce c moles of C and d moles of D. Thus, if you want to know how many grams of D will be produced, and you know how much A you have, calculate the number of moles of A present. From this, you can determine how many moles of D can be generated, since you know that a moles of A will produce d moles of D. With this in mind, you can proceed to answer these questions. From the first equation, you see that if you start with 1 mole of sulfur (S), 1 mole of SO_2 can be generated (since all the coefficients are one, although 1 is not written). Now that 1 mole of SO_2 is generated, you proceed to the second equation. It states that for every 2molesof SO_2, 2 moles of SO_3 are generated. Thus, in keeping with this relative ratio, 1 mole of SO_3 can be generated from one mole of SO_2. In the third reaction you again have 1 mole of SO_3 yielding 1 mole of H_2 SO_4. At this point, you have 1 mole of N_2 SO_4 (from 1 mole of starting sulfur). The last equation shows 1 mole of H_2S0_4 producing 1 mole of Na_2 SO_4. Therefore, if you where to start with 1 mole of S, you would obtain 1 mole of Na_2 SO_4. Now let us consider H_2 O. Water does not enter the sequence until the third equation.

Therefore, if you start with 4.5 grams of H_2 O, .25molesof Na_2 SO_4 will be produced.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E05-0185.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "1 mole of Na_2 SO_4, .25 moles of Na_2 SO_4"}
{"question": "Some sex-linked traits are expressed more often in girls than in boys, while others are expressed more often in boys than in girls.", "solution": "The X chromosome carries not only the genes for sex, but also many other genes not related to sex, such as the gene for color blindness or the gene for hemophilia. Such genes are called sex-linked, because they are located on the sex chromosome. The Y chromo-some does not carry any genes that we know of other than those which are related to the expression of the male sex. Girls have two X chromosomes. Boys have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Each individual inherits one sex chromosome from each parent, so that a girl gets one X chromosome from her mother and one X chromosome from her father. A boy receives an X chromosome from his mother and a Y chromosome from his father. (His mother cannot give him a Y chromosome, as she has only X chromo-somes to give). Since the genes for sex-linked traits are carried only on the X chromosome , it follows that a girl would have twice the chance of receiving a sex-linked gene than would a boy, because she receives two X chromosomes, while a boy receive only one. Thus a girl has a chance to receive a sex-linked gene if either of her parents carry that gene. A boy, however , could only receive such a gene from his mother, even if his father carried that gene on his X chromosome. Although a girl has a greater chance than a boy of receiving a sex- linked gene, the chance that either of them will express thetraitcoded for by that gene varies according to the dominant or recessive nature of the gene . For example, if the gene for a sex-linked trait is dominant, that trait would be more commonly expressed in girls than in boys. Because it is dominant , only one copy of the gene is necessary for its expression. Since girls have a greater chance of receiving a copy of a sex-linked gene, they have a greater chance of expressing its trait. If a sex-linked trait is recessive, a boy would have a greater chance of expressing the trait. In order for a girl to express that trait, she would have to have two copies of the recessive gene, because its expression would be masked by the presence of a normal X chromosome or one with a dominant allele. Thus both her parents would have to carry the gene. A boy however, need only have one copy of the gene in order to express its trait , because his Y chromosome does not carry any genes that would mask the recessive gene. So only his mother need carry the gene. The chances of this happening are much greater than the chance that two people carrying the gene will mate and have a girl, so the trait is more commonly expressed in boys. It is important to note that girls still have a greater chance of receiving a single copy of a recessive gene, although they may not express it. Such individuals are called carriers, and their frequency in the population is greater than that of individuals expressing the trait, be they male or female.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F25-0666.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Sex-linked traits are expressed more often in girls or boys depending on whether the gene for the trait is dominant or recessive.

{"question": "In an experiment, x-rays of frequency f are scattered by the electrons in a block of paraffin. It is found that the x-rays scat-tered at an angle of less than 900, have a wavelength f ', greater than f. Interpret this result in terms of a collision of a photon with an electron.", "solution": "The collision is shown in the diagram. The photon is scat-tered through an angle \\texttheta, and the electron through an angle \\varphi. The momentum of the photon is given by the de Broglie relationship. p = h/\\lambda = hf/cusing \\lambdaf = c As in all collision problems, the law of conservation of momentum may be applied to this collision. The momentum of the photon-electron system, then must remain constant throughout the collision. Since momentum is a vector quantity, (having both direction and mag-nitude) we must resolve the momenta of the electron and photon into x and y components. Conservation of momentum can then be applied as follows: hf/c = (hf '/c)cos \\texttheta + mv cos \\varphi (x component)(1) (hf '/c)sin \\texttheta = mv sin \\varphi (y component)(2) The law of conservation of energy can also be applied to the collision analysis because the collision is elastic. The total energy of the electron- photon system must then remain constant throughout the col-lision. Or hf + m_0c^2 = hf ' + mc^2(3) where m_0 is the rest mass of the electron. And m is the new relativistic mass [= m_0 / \\surd{1 - (v^2/c^2)}] It incorporates the kinetic energy the electron has, after the col-lision. The angle \\varphi can be eliminated by squaring (1) and (2) and adding.

Therefore by subtracting (4) from (5) we obtain [h(f - f') + m_0c^2]^2 - h^2(f^2 + f'^2 - 2ff' cos \\texttheta) = m^2c^2(c^2 - v^2) = m2_0c^4.

{"question": "Classify the bonds in the following as ionic, ionic - covalent, covalent - ionic and covalent: I_2,LiCl,MgTe, Cl_2O, H_2S.", "solution": "The bonds in these molecules can be classified by considering the electronegativities of the atoms in-volved . Theelectronegativityof any element is the tendency of that element to attract electrons. The greater theelectronegativity, the stronger the attraction. When 2 atoms join, the type of bond formed can be determined by calculating the difference inelectronegativityof the two atoms involved. When the difference is greater than the bond is classified as ionic, if less than 1.7, then the bond is covalent. An ionic bond involves the complete transfer of electrons from 1 atom to another, while in a covalent bond, the electrons are shared between like or similar atoms. Covalent-ionic indicates a mixed character which is more covalent in nature. Ionic - covalent bonds have more of an ionic character. Consider the cases in point. For I_2, there is no difference in electronegativity because the 2 atoms involved in the bond are the same, and hence contains a covalent bond with equal sharing of the electrons. InLiCl, theelectronagetivitiesare Li = 1.0 andCl= 3.0. (The electronegativity values are obtained from anelectronegativitytable). The electronegative difference is 2.0. Therefore, the bond is ionic.

{"question": "How was it proven that DNA replication is semi-conservative?", "solution": "Three possible models v/ere considered to account for DNA replication, the process by which the two complementary strands of the double helical DNA replicate to form new complementary strands. In the first model, called conservative replication, the two strands of parental DNA replicate to yield the unchanged parental DNA and a newly synthesized DNA. The second model, semi-conservative replication, claims that the replication of one DNA molecule yields two hybrids, each composed of one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand. Finally, the third model, dispersive replication, has the parental strand breaking at intervals. These parental segments then combine with new segments to form the daughter strands(see Figure 1). Meselson and Stahl's classic experiments proved that DNA replicates by a semi-conservative mechanism. They grew E. coli cells for several generations on a medium which contained \"heavy\" nitrogen, ^15N. Thus, all the nitrogen bases of the E. coli DNA were labeled with ^15N instead of the normal or \"light\" nitrogen, ^15N. The ^14N - DNA of these cells could be separated from the ^14N - DNA by equilibrium centrifugation in a cesium-chloride gradient . because the ^15N - DNA has a significantly greater density than the ^14N - DNA. Meselson and Stahl took the \"heavy\" (^15N containing) cells and placed them in a 11 light\" (lf\\textasteriskcenteredN containing) medium. The cells were allowed to grow for several generations and were analyzed at various generation times. From the samples collected, the DNA was examined by determining its buoyant density with cesium-chloride density gradients. It was found that after one generation, the isolated DNA showed only a single band falling midway between the places where the heavy and light bands lie in a cesium-chloride density gradient, This is to be expected if the first generation DNA is a hybrid of one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand. After two generations, the isolated DNA exhibited two bands, one equal to the hybrid density of the first generation and one having a density equal to that of normal \"light\" DNA. After many generations passed, a \\textquotedblleftlight\" density band of DNA predominated. These observations are consistent with those expected from the hypothesis of semi-conservative replication but not with the other two models (see Figure 2) .", "images": ["images/F24-0614_files/image002.jpg", "images/F24-0614_files/image004.jpg", "images/F24-0614_files/image006.jpg", "images/F24-0614_files/image008.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F24-0614.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Meselson and Stahl's classic experiments proved that DNA replicates by a semi-conservative mechanism."}

{"question": "Microtubules and microfilaments both appear to be involved inintracellular motion and in intracellular structural support. How do the two organelles differ in structure andfunction andhow are they similar?", "solution": "Microtubules are thin, hollow cylinders, approximately 200 to 300Angstroms in diameter.Micro-filaments are not hollow, and are 50 to 80 Angstroms in diameter.Both microtubules and microfilaments are com- posedof proteins. The protein of microtubules is generally termedtubulin. Tubule proteins can be made to assemble into microtubules in a test tube, ifthe proper reagents are present. Some of the narrower microfilaments havebeen shown to be composed of proteins similar toactin.Actinis a proteininvolved in muscle cellcontration. The composition of thicker microfilamentshas not been completely determined. Microtubules are often distributed in cells in arrangement that suggesttheir role in maintaining cell shape (a \"cytoskeletal\" role). For example, microtubules are arranged longitudinally within the elongated processesof nerve cells (axons) and thecytoplasmicextensions (pseudopods) of certain protozoa. Microtubules are ar-ranged in a circular bandin the disc-shaped fish red blood cells. Microfilaments may also play astructural role. They are often associated with some specialized region ofthe plasma membrane, such as the absorptive plasma membrane of the intestinalcells, or the portions of the plasma membrane which serve to anchoradjacent cells together so that they can intercommunicate. Microtubules are components of cilia and flagella, and participate in therapid movements of these struc-tures. Microtubules are involved in directionalmovement within the cell during cell division, and are involved incertain types of oriented rapid intracellular movement. Microfilaments seemto be involved in many different types ofcytoplasmicmovement. They are believed to play a role in amoeboid motion of cells, and in the rapidstreaming of the cytoplasm of plant cells about a central vacuole.

{"question": "Write a FORTRAN program that generates the prime numbers in the 1-2000 interval, using an ancient method known as the SIEVE of ERATOSTHENES.", "solution": "A prime is a number which has only 2 divisors: 1 and itself. There is an ancient method for finding the primes from 2 (the smallest prime) to some number N, called the SIEVE of ERATOSTHENES. This method works as follows: First, the integers from 2 to N are written down. Then, the multiples of the smal-lest available integer, 2, greater than this integer, are crossed out. This step, obviously, eliminates all the even numbers except 2. The procedure is then repeated for the next smallest available integer-3, and then next - 5, because 4 is not available, since it was eliminated during the first step, and so on... Thus, the initial list is scanned repeatedly, and the appropriate integers are crossed off, until the next least remaining integer considered is greater than \\surdN. At this point, all the remaining integers are indeed all the primes between 2 and N. The program is created based upon the above discussion. First, an array of integers from 2 to 2000 is generated. Next, this array is scanned repeatedly, deleting the appropriate integers by replacing them with zeros. At the point when the considered integer is greater than \\surd2000 , all the nonzero elements of the array are placed left justified within the array and then printed.

{"question": "What are the major constituents of a productive soil? Whatis the role of each of these constituents in plant growth? What measures can be taken to prevent the loss of topsoil?", "solution": "A rich, fertile soil should contain sufficient quantities of the essential mineralnutrients. It should also contain an adequate amount of organic materials which is provided by humus. In addition, it should include innumerable bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms to bring about decay of organic substances and aeration of the soil. The essential minerals play important roles in the structure and functions of the plant. The broadest role of the minerals is their action in catalyzing enzymatic reactions in the cell. In some cases they act as an essential structural component of the enzyme, in others they act as regulators or activators of certain enzymes. Some minerals, absorbed in the ionic form by active transport, function in providing a hydrostatic pressure , orturgorwithin the cell. In other words, their con-centrations inside the cell or in the surrounding medium regulate the movement of water in and out of the cell. Some minerals regulate the permeability and integrity of cell membranes, while others serve as structural components of cell parts. Other minerals constitute structural parts of the electron acceptors of the electron transport system, such as thecytochromesand ferredoxin . Still others act as buffering agents to prevent drastic changes in pH within the cell. Humus, derived from the decaying remains of plants and animals , provides the soil with organic nutrients, among them mainly carbon - and nitrogen-containing compounds. In addition, humus increases the porosity of soil so that proper drainage and aeration can occur, and enhances the ability of the soil to absorb and hold water. To bring about decomposition of the humus, a good soil should contain a large number of bacteria, fungi, and other small organisms. Such organisms, as the earthworms, benefit the soil further by constantly tilling the soil, aerating it, and mixing in additional organic substances. A major conservation problem all over the world is to decrease the amount of valuable topsoil carried away each year by wind and water.

{"question": "Discuss the citric acid cycle as the common pathway of oxidation of carbohydrates, fatty acids and amino acids.", "solution": "The oxidation of the above substances all yield products which either enter or are intermediates of the citric acid (also known as Krebs and TCA, tricarboxylic acid) cycle. Glucose, a carbohydrate, undergoes a series of reactions in glycolysis to be oxidized to pyruvic acid. Pyruvic acid reacts with coenzyme A to yield acetyl coenzyme A. It is acetyl coenzyme A which enters the citric acid cycle (see Figure). Acetyl coenzyme A is also formed from the oxidation of fatty acids. A repeating series of reactions cleaves the long carbon chain of a fatty acid into mole-cules of acetyl coenzyme A. Finally, amino acids are metabolized by one of several reactions to products capable of participating in the reactions of the TCA cycle. The first step in the oxidation of all amino acids is a deamination reaction by which an amino group (\\ElzbarNH_2) is removed from the amino acid. For three amino acids, this is the only reaction required for conversion into a compound entering the TCA cycle directly. Alanine undergoes deamination to form pyruvate which is converted into acetyl coenzyme A. The deamination of glutamic acid yields \\alpha-ketoglutaric acid,while that of aspartic acid yields oxaloacetic acid. Both these compounds are intermediates of the TCA cycle.

The diamond lattice surrounds each carbon atom by 4 others in a tetrahedral configuration. There exist covalent bonds between the carbon atoms, which means they share electrons. These covalent forces are responsible for the hard nature and high melting point of the substance. On the other hand, graphite has covalent bonding in two-dimensional, planar, hexagonal rings.

{"question": "A biology student is presented with two jars. One is labelled \"bacterial flagella\" and the other is tagged \"protozoan flagella\". He is told they may be improperly labelled. How can he conclusively differentiate the flagella? Also discuss the role of flagella in bacteria", "solution": "The extremely thin hairlike appendages that protrude through the cell wall of some bacterial cells are called flagella. The length of a flagellum is usually several times the length of the cell, but the diameter of a flagellum is only a fraction of the diameter (the width) of the cell. Baccilli and spirilla usually have flagella, which are rarely found on cocci. Flagella occur singly, in tufts, or equally distributed around the periphery of the cell. Flagella are responsible for the motility of bacteria. Not all bacteria have flagella, and thus not all are motile. The mechanism by which the flagella move the bacterial cell is not completely understood; however, it is proposed that movement requires rotation of the semi-stiff flagellum. Whatever the mechanism, the flagellum moves the cell at a very high speed and it enables the bacterium to travel many times its length per second. Bacterial flagella are structurally different from the flagella Qfi eucaryotic cells. This difference can be used to distinguish the bacterial (procaryotic) flagella from the protozoan (eucaryotic) flagella. By examining a cross section of the flagellum under an electron microscope, one can conclusively determine its identity. The eucaryotic flagellum contains a cytoplasmic matrix, with ten groups of tubular fibrils embedded in the matrix: nine pairs of fibrils around the periphery of the eucaryotic flagellum surround two central single fibrils. (see below). Bacterial flagella consist of only a single fibril and lack the (\"9 + 2\") structural organization of the eucaryotic flagellum. Most bacterial flagella have the same diameter as a single fibril from a eucaryotic flagellum and hence they are usually thinner.", "images": ["images/F05-0119_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F05-0119.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "By examining a cross section of the flagellum under an electron microscope, one can conclusively determine its identity.

This is the product of the pressures of the products divided by pressure of the reactant. These pressures are brought to the powers of their coefficients. From this, employ Dalton's law concerning partial pressures to help solve forK_p. At p = 10atm, assumeK_pis pressure-independent because of ideal gas behavior. This, then, allows the determination of the degree of dissociation from theK_pexpression. Thus, one commences by the definition ofK_p. K_p= [(P_SO2 P_CI2)/(P_SO2 CI2)] To findK_p, evaluate these partial pressures. To do this, useRaoult'slaw, which states partial pressure of gas = mole fraction of gas in mixture times total pressure, i.e., p =Xp_T. Thep_Tis given as 1 atm. Thus, the key is to determine or represent the mole fraction X. Let \"a\" = the degree of dissociation of SO_2Cl_2 . From the chemical equation, it is seen that SO_2 and Cl_2 are formed inequimolaramounts. Thus, at equilibrium there are \"a\" moles of both SO_2 and Cl_2 . Starting with 1 mole of SO_2Cl_2 and \"a\" moles dissociated, then, at equilibrium, there remain 1 - a moles. In the mixture, therefore, total number of moles = (1 - a) + a + a = (1 + a). Thus, P_SO2CI2 = X_SO2CI2 P_T = [(1 - a)/(1 + a)] P_T , P_SO2 = P_CI2 = [a/(1 + a)]P_T .

{"question": "Suppose someone told you that plants bend toward the light so that their leaves will be better exposed for photosynthesis. Tell how you could demonstrate by experiments that this may not be a scientific explanation of the growth toward the light.", "solution": "If plants bend toward the light in order to have their leaves exposed to sunlight, one would assume then, that the signal for stem-bending comes from the leaves. In other words, there will be a mechanism present in the leaves which allows them to receive the stimulus of sunlight and consequently direct the stem to elongate and bend in the direction of the light. We can test the validity of this hypothesis by defoliating the plant. If our hypothesis is correct, removing the leaves would also remove the receptors of the stimulus by light and the effectors of the signal to bend, and no bending of the stem should occur. We know, however, that as long as the apex is intact, a defoliated stem will bend toward the light. The coleoptile tip of the oat seedling, for instance, is a non-leaf-bearing structure which has been used in classical demonstrations of phototropism (the growth response to light). Since a stem will bend toward the sun even if it has no leaves, one cannot really say that plants bend toward the sun purposefully in order to better expose their leaves for photosynthesis. Our experiment has shown that the leaves themselves do not hold the controlling key to bending. We can advance a step further and test the role of the tip of the stem in phototropism. If the apex is involved in the bending of the stem toward light, covering the tip from the light or removing it totally should prevent phototropism. It has, in fact, been observed in experiments that both operations do prevent phototropism as well as inhibit growth. Replacing the tip on the decapitated stem actually brings about resumed growth and bending of the stem. Thus it is clear that the apical meristem of the stem rather than the leaves of the plant is responsible for the phenomenon of phototropism.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F09-0229.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The apical meristem of the stem rather than the leaves of the plant is responsible for the phenomenon of phototropism."}

{"question": "Using the pedigree below, determine the method of inheritance of the trait, and as far as possible, fill in the genotypes of each individual.", "solution": "One should immediately note that the trait is only exhibited by male members of the family. Although the number of individuals is small enough that this could have been a a chance occurrence, it strongly suggests that the trait is sex-linked. Proceeding on this assumption, we can deduce the possible genotype of each member. Letting r represent the recessive, sex-linked allele, we can assign the genotype X^rY to P_1, F_1,7, F_2,1 ,F_2,3 ,F_2,5 ,and F_3,1, since all are males expressing the trait. Since F_2,7 ,a male, does not express the trait, and there-fore does not carry the r allele, his genotype is X^RY, where R represents the normal allele. We know that F_3,1 must have received the r allele from his mother, F_2,6 since to a male offspring, the mother contributes the X while the father contributes the Y chromosome. The genotype of F_2,6 is then X^RX^r, since she does not express the trait. F_1,5 must also be a carrier (X^RX^r) since F_2,6 is a carrier, F _2,5 expresses the trait, and F1,4,who must be X^RY, could not have donated the recessive allele to his offspring. Since we have no information concerning the offspring of F_2,4 ,her genotype could be either X^RX^R or X^Rx^r, depending on whether she received a dominant or recessive allele from F_1,5 . Since F_1,5 is a carrier, and her father P_3 ,who does not express the trait, is X^RY, we can assign P_4, the geno-type X^RX^r , which shows that she is also a carrier. F_1,6 can be either X^RX^R or X^Rx^r, one dominant allele in either case being necessarily donated by P_3. F_1,3 a male not expressing the trait, is X^RY. Since no male offspring of P_1 and P_2 express the trait, it is likely though not necessary, that P_2 .is not a carrier. Her possible genotypes are X^RX^R and X^Rx^r. F_1,2 must have received the recessive allele from P_1 and be a carrier (X^Rx^r). F_1,1 must be X^RY since he does not express the trait. F_2,2 could be either X^RX^R or X^RX^r. Summarizing, we can see that our assumption of sex linkage is consistent with the inheritance pattern of the trait :", "images": ["images/F26-0688_files/image002.jpg", "images/F26-0688_files/image004.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F26-0688.htm", "image_question": true, "image_answer": true, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The trait is sex-linked"}

{"question": "To produce a minimum reflection of wavelengths near the middle of the visible spectrum (550 m\\mu), how thick a coating of MgF_2 (n = 1.38) should be vacuum-coated on a glass surface?", "solution": "Consider light to be incident at near-normal incidence. We wish to cause destructive interference be-tween rays r_1 and r_2 that maximum energy passes into the glass. A phase change of 1/2\\lambda occurs in each ray, for at both the upper and lower surfaces of the MgF_2 film, the light is reflected by a medium at greater index of refrac-tion. When striking a medium of lower index refraction, the light is reflected with no phase change. Since in this problem both ray 1 and 2 experience the same phase shift, no net change of phase is produced by these two reflections. Hence the only way a phase change can occur is if the 2 rays travel through different optical path lengths. (the optical path length is defined as the product of the geo metric distance a ray travels through and the refractive index of the medium in which the ray is travelling). For destructive interference, the 2 rays must be out of phase by an odd number of half wavelengths.

What is the empirical formula of nicotine?", "solution": "The empirical formula states the relative ratio of the atoms of the variouselements in any substance; the actual number of atoms (molecular formula) is not implied. Problems of this sort are solved by assuming a sampleof some convenient mass and then calculating the number of molesof each atom in this sample. Once the number of moles has been calculatedfor each component, these numbers are divided by the greatest commonfactor in order to obtain the proportions in which the various componentsappear in the molecule. There is no error in assuming a sampleof definite mass, since the size of a sample of molecules does not affectthe composition of the molecules. Assume a sample weighing 100 g.

{"question": "What is meant by the \"vital capacity\" of a person? In what conditions is it increased or decreased?", "solution": "During a single normal breath, the volume of air entering or leaving the lungs is called the tidal vol-ume. Under conditions of rest, this volume is approximately 500 ml. on average. The volume of air that can be in-spired over and above the resting tidal volume is called the inspiratory reserve volume, and amounts to about 3000 ml. of air. Similarly, the volume of air that can be expired below the resting tidal volume is called the expiratory reserve volume, and amounts to approximately 1000 ml. of air. Even after forced maximum expiration, some air (about 1000 ml.) still remains in the lungs, and is termed the residual volume. The vital capacity is the sum of the tidal volume and the inspiratory and expiratory reserve volumes. The vital capacity then represents the maximum amount of air that can be moved in and out during a single breath. The average vital capacity varies with sex, being 4.5 liters for the young adult male, and about 3.2 for the young adult female. During heavy work or exercise, a person uses part of both the inspira-tory and expiratory reserves, but rarely uses more than 50% of his total vital capacity. This is because deeper breaths than this would require exhaustive activities of the inspiratory and expiratory muscles. Vital capacity is higher in an individual who is tall and thin than in one who is obese. A well developed athlete may have a vital capacity up to 55% above average.

E = F/q We are given the distance the electron travels and the time it takes. We must try to find a relation-ship to use in solving for the unknown F, in order to determine E. Then: For a uniform electric field, the force on the electron is constant; hence, the acceleration, a = F_E/m_e, is also constant.

{"question": "Discuss the operation of (1) a voltmeter across a 12v. battery with an internal resistance r = 2\\Omega, (2) an ammeter in series with a 4\\Omega resistor connected to the terminals of the same battery.", "solution": "(1)Consider a source whose emf \\epsilon is constant and equal to 12 volts, and whose internal resistance r is 2 ohms. (The internal resistance of a commercial 12-volt lead storage battery is only a few thousandths of an ohm.) Figure 1 represents the source with a volt-meter V connected between its terminals a and b . A voltmeter reads the potential difference between its terminals. If it is of the conventional type, the voltmeter provides a conducting path between the terminals and so there is current in the source (and through the voltmeter). We shall assume, however, that the resistance of the volt-meter is so large (essentially infinite) that it draws no appreciable current. The source is then an open circuit, corresponding to a source with open terminals and the voltmeter reading V_ab equals the emf \\epsilon of the source, or 12 volts. (2)In Fig. 2, an ammeter A and a resistor of resistance R = 4\\Omega have been connected to the terminals of the source to form a closed circuit. The total resistance of the circuit is the sum of the re-sistance R, the internal resistance r, and the resistance of the ammeter. The ammeter resistance, however, can be made very small, and we shall assume it so small (essentially zero) that it can be neglected. The ammeter (whatever its resistance) reads the current I through it. The circuit corresponds to a source with a 4\\Omega resistance across its terminals. The wires connecting the resistor to the source and the ammeter, shown by straight lines, ideally have zero resistance and hence there is no potential difference between their ends. Thus points a and a' are at the same potential and are electrically equivalent, as are points b and b'. The potential differences V_ab , and V_a'b' . are therefore equal. The current I in the resistor (and hence at all points of the circuit) could be found from the relation I = V_ab /R, if the potential difference V_ab were known. However, V_ab is the terminal voltage of the source, equal to \\epsilon - Ir, and since this depends on I it is unknown at the start. We can, however, calculate the current from the circuit equa-tion: I = (\\epsilon/R + r) = [(12 volts)/(4\\Omega + 2\\Omega)] = 2 amp.

{"question": "What is a chemical reaction? What is meant by the rate- limiting step of a chemical reaction?", "solution": "A necessary requirement of a chemical reaction is that the products be chemically different from the reactants. Therefore a chemical reaction is one in which bonds are broken and/or formed. Some chemical reactions have only a single step, with only one bond being formed or broken. In multistep reactions, a certain sequence of bond formation and bond breakages proceed. Usually the formation of a chemical bond releases energy, and the products formed are more stable than the reactants, in that they have a lower potential energy. The breakage of a bond requires some form of energy which is absorbed by the bond, giving products that, together, will exist at a higher potential energy. Thus, a reaction that requires heat to proceed and usually involves breaking bonds is termed an endothermic reaction. A reaction that proceeds with the release of heat and usually involves forming bonds is termed an exothermic reaction. Aside from bond changes, there is a change in potential energy or enthalpy and there can be a change in entropy, or orderliness that accompanies the reaction. There is a tendency for chemical systems to go toward minimum energy or enthalpy and thus achieve maximum stability. There is also a tendency toward maximum disorder or entropy. These two concepts can be combined in a new function called free energy (G) , which is the energy that is available for doing work. G = \u2206H - T\u2206S , where \u2206Hrepresents the change in enthalpy \u2206Srepresents the change in entropy Tis the temperature in Kelvin \u2206Gis the spontaneous change in free energy In order for a chemical reaction to proceed, \u2206G must be negative. A loss in enthalpy will be represented by a negative \u2206H and a gain in entropy by a positive \u2206S. If \u2206G is positive, energy would have to be added to the system to drive the reaction forward. Most chemical reactions occurring in the living cell are not simple, one-step reactions. Many contain a series of consecutive steps coupled, or linked, by common intermediates with the product of the first step being the reactant in the second step, and the product of the second step is the reactant in the third, and so on. The \u2206G of such reactions is the sum of the \u2206G's of the individual steps. Each step of the reaction has its own activation energy, and the one requiring the highest activation complex is kinetically the most un-favorable one. In other words, it will have the slowest rate and will for this reason determine the rate of the entire reaction.

{"question": "What is the structure arid function of the chloroplasts in green plants?", "solution": "The chloroplasts have the ability to transform the energy of the sun into chemical energy stored in bonds that hold together the atom of such foods (fuel) as glucose. By the process of photosynthesis, carbon dioxide and water react to produce carbohydrates with the simultaneous re-lease of oxygen. Photosynthesis, which occurs in the chloro-plasts, is driven forward by energy obtained from the sun. Photosynthesis involves two major sets of reactions, each consisting of many steps. One set depends on light and cannot occur in the dark; hence, this set is known as the light reaction. It is responsible for the production of ATP from sunlight and the release of oxygen derived from water. This process is known as photophosphorylation. The other set, referred to as the dark reaction, is not dependent on light. In the dark reaction, carbon dioxide is reduced to carbo-hydrates using the energy of ATP from the light reactions. Chlorophyll, the pigment contained in chloroplasts which gives plants their characteristic green color, is the molecule responsible for the initial trapping of light energy. Chlorophyll transforms light energy into chemical energy; then it passes this energy to a chain of other compounds involved in the light and dark reactions. Plastids are organelles which contain pigments and/or function in nutrient storage. Chloroplasts are but one example os a plastid; they give the green color to plants. Each chloroplast is bounded by two layers of membranes; the outer one is not connected with the other membranes of the cell. The inner membrane gives rise to the complex internal system of the chloroplast. Surrounding the in-ternal membranes is a ground substance termed the stroma. The stroma contains the enzymes which carry out the dark reactions of photosynthesis. Granules containing starch are also found in the stroma. The internal membrane system of the chloroplast are usually in the form of flattened sacs called thylakoids (see accompanying diagram) . A stack of thylakoids is called a granum (plural - grana). The lamel-lae contain the chlorophyll molecules and other pigments involved in photosynthesis. The layered structure of the granum is extremely crucial for the efficient transfer of energy from one pigment molecule to another without the dissipation of a great deal of energy in the process.", "images": ["images/F02-0048_files/image002.gif"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F02-0048.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The chloroplasts transform the energy of the sun into chemical energy stored in bonds that hold together the atom of such foods as glucose.

{"question": "H. Hertz produced radio waves whose wavelength was about 3 m. What was the frequency of the oscillating electric charges responsible for this electromagnetic radiation?", "solution": "Hertz produced radio waves by use of an induction coil. This alternating current generator was connected in series with a metal loop containing a gap in it (see the figure). A second loop (the receiver) with a similar gap was placed a few feet away from the first loop (the transmitter). The induction coil created an arc discharge across the gap of the transmitting circuit. A similar discharge appeared across the gap of the receiving circuit. Apparently, the disturbance at the first circuit was transmitted to the second circuit. This disturbance was shown to propagate with the speed of light c. The effect of the AC generator is to cause the electric charge within the wire in the transmitting circuit to oscillate about an equilibrium position. An oscillating charge undergoes acceleration and emits electromagnetic radiation with a frequency equal to the oscillating frequency of the charge. The electro-magnetic wave disturbance is transmitted through space. When it reaches the. receiving circuit, it causes the charge in the wire to oscillate. An AC current is then created. An arc discharge is then developed across the gap due to this current.

What angular velocity of the man and platform is produced in consequence? The man then walks so as to bring him to a position halfway between the rim and the center of the platform. What is the new angular velocity of the system?", "solution": "The package is thrown tangentially at a speed of 20 m.s^-1 relative to the ground and consequently has an initial angular momentum about the center of the platform form given by \\vertL\\ding{217}\\vert = \\vertr\\ding{217}\u00d7 mv\\ding{217}\\vert = \\vertmvrsin\\texttheta\\vert = mvr = 1 kg \u00d7 20 m\\bullets^-1 \u00d7 4m \\ding{217} \\ding{217} \\ding{217} = 80 kg\\bulletm^2\\bullets^-1. where \\texttheta(=90\\textdegree) is the angle between r\\ding{217}and v\\ding{217}. \\ding{217} \\ding{217} Since the platform is free to rotate about its center, there are no external (e.g. in the form of friction) forces acting on the man-package- platform system. There are no external torques acting on this system, but \\Gamma\\ding{217}= dL\\ding{217}/dt \\ding{217} \\ding{217} where \\Gamma\\ding{217}is the sum of the external torques acting on the system. Thus \\ding{217} 0 = dL\\ding{217}/dt \\ding{217} L\\ding{217}= constant \\ding{217} That is, the angular momentum of the system remains the same at all instances of time when no external force acts on the system. This is the principle of conservation of angular momentum. Since the man-package- platform system was initially at rest, L\\ding{217}= 0. After the package is thrown, \\ding{217} L\\ding{217}must still be zero, thus the man-platform must acquire a momentum \\ding{217} Equal and opposite to the momentum of the package, to satisfy the condition that the L\\ding{217}= 0 for the man-platform-package system at all times. \\ding{217} The plat- form is a distributed mass, as opposed to the localized masses of the man and package (which to a very good approximation may be treated as point masses). The fol-lowing expression involving the moment of inertia I of the platform must then be used. (The moment of inertia accounts for this mass distribution).

I for the uni-form circular platform is I_1 = (1/2) m_1R2 where m_1 is the mass of the platform and R is its radius.For the man, the definition of moment of inertia for adiscrete particle gives I_2 = m_2R^2,where m_2 is the man'smass.

Glucose exists in two forms, one of which is the mirror image of the other. Its configurational formulas may be written At one time, it was believed that these glucose isomers existed in this linear form. Now, however, it is believed that cyclic forms exist, as indicated in the accompanying diagram. This has been postulated for the following reasons: It has been found that when you take a solution of pure (+) - glucose or a solution of pure (-) - glucose form, a pair of optical isomers are obtained, i.e., ones with the ability to rotate plane- polarized light. For this to occur, in a solution of pure (+) or (-) glucose, another asymmetric carbon must be present. An asymmetric carbon is one with 4 different atoms or molecules attached. Asymmetric carbons can generate optical isomers. In the formation of cyclic structures, the carbon atom of the aldehyde group (C = O) must be the additional asymmetric carbon. This would account for the two optical isomers formed. In other words, that glucose exists in cyclic forms was deduced from the fact that only in such a structure is an additional asymmetric carbon generated, which would account for the optical somers produced.", "images": ["images/E23-0834_files/image002.jpg", "images/E23-0834_files/image004.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E23-0834.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Glucose exists in cyclic forms was deduced from the fact that only in such a structure is an additional asymmetric carbon generated, which would account for the optical somers produced."}

The elasticity is what causes a restoring force to act on any part of the medium displaced from its equilibrium position. The reaction of the displaced portion of the medium to the re-storing force depends on its inertia. for a stretched wire, the tension T is a measure of its elasticity; the greater the tension, the greater is the elastic restoring force on the displaced portion of wire.

{"question": "What are the roles of coenzyme A in metabolism ?", "solution": "Coenzyme A is a large, complex organic molecule involved in a number of key reactions in the cell. The functions of coenzyme A are several. In glycolysis, glucose is converted to pyruvate. To enter the Krebs acid cycle (also known as the tricarboxylic acid, or TCA cycle and the citric acid cycle) , pyruvate must be con-verted to another form; such a conversion first involves decarboxylation of pyruvate (loss of carbon dioxide), then a reaction with coenzyme A, and finally, a dehydrogenation re-action, to yield acetyl coenzyme A. The reactions are rep-resented as follows: The acetate group is bonded to the coenzyme A molecule via a high energy bond. The energy of this bond in acetyl coenzyme A is utilized to transfer the acetyl group to oxaloacetic acid, the first reaction of the TCA cycle. Coenzyme A is also involved in a reaction farther along in the cycle. An intermediate (derived from \\alpha- Ketoglutarate) combines with coenzyme A to yield succinyl coenzyme A. The bond connecting coenzyme A to succinate is also of high energy. The energy in this bond is converted to an energy-rich phosphate bond,\\simP, through the addition of an inorganic \\sim phosphate. The phosphate group is subsequently transfered to GDP to produce GTP and free succinate. The reactions are diagrammed below: Coenzyme A is also utilized in fatty acid oxidation. The metabolism of a fatty acid initially involves its activation by ATP and coenzyme A to fatty acyl coenzyme A. Through a repeating series of reactions, fatty acyl coenyzme A is converted to acetyl coenzyme A, which, in turn, goes into the TCA cycle As a general rule, coenzyme A is involved in reactions which utilize its high-energy bond in order to more effectively facilitate metabolism. The sequence of reactions, wherein Acyl CoA is shortened by two carbon atoms, repeats itself until the Acyl CoA is shortened to Acetyl CoA.", "images": ["images/F03-0074_files/image002.jpg", "images/F03-0074_files/image004.jpg", "images/F03-0074_files/image006.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F03-0074.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Coenzyme A is involved in glycolysis, the Krebs acid cycle, and fatty acid oxidation.

The contraction forces into the ventricles only 30% of the blood that will fill them. How the other 70% enters the ventricles will be explained shortly. During contraction of the two atria, the tricuspid and bicuspid valves are opened. There is a very brief pause before ven-tricular systole begins due to the delay in transmission of the cardiac impulse at the atrio-ventricular or A-V node. The impulse is then transmitted to the A-V bundle and bundle branches and then very rapidly to the Purkinje fibers, which stimulate the ventricles to contract as a unit. The contraction of the ventricular muscles causes a rapid increase in pressure in the ventricles. This increased ventricular pressure immediately closes the tricuspid and bicuspid valves, preventing backflow of the blood into the atria. It is important to realize that the valves work passively. There is no nervous stimulation which directly regu-lates their opening and closing; it is only the difference in pressure due to the relative amount of blood in the atria and ventricles (or ventricles and arteries) which controls this. As ventricular systole progresses, the ventricular pressure further increases (due to contraction). At this point, no blood is en-tering the ventricles, since the tri- and bicuspid valves are closed, and no blood is leaving, since the semilunarvalves are closed. When the-ventricular pressure becomes greater than the pressure in the arteries (the pulmonary artery and the aorta), thesemilunarvalves open and blood is forced into these vessels. After the ventricles complete their contraction, ventricular diastole begins. As the ventricles relax, the pressure decreases. When the ventricular pressure is less than arterial pressure, thesemilunarvalves shut, preventing backflow. Since the pressure in the ventricles is still higher than in the atria, the tri- and bi-cuspid valves are still closed, and no blood enters or leaves the ventricles. But some blood is entering the now relaxed atria. During further relaxation of the ventricles, the ventricular pres-sure continues to decrease until it falls below theatrialpressure. At this point, the tri- and bicuspid valves open, allowing blood to rapidly flow into the ventricles. The atria do not contract to force this blood into the ventricles. It is a passive flow due to the fact that theatrialpressure is greater than the ventricular pressure. This flow allows for 70% of the ventricular filling beforeatrialsystole. Thus, the major amount of ventricular fil-ling occurs during diastole, notatrialsystole, as one might expect.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F15-0377.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The major amount of ventricular filling occurs during diastole, not atrial systole, as one might expect.

{"question": "If two fruit flies, heterozygous for genes of one allelic pair, were bred together and had 200 offspring a) about how many would have the dominant phenotype? b) Of these offspring, some will be homozygous dominant and some heterozygous.

Therefore, the expected number with the dominant phenotype is 3/4 \u00d7 200 or 150. b) To establish which of the dominant phenotypes are homozygous and which are heterozygous, we have to perform a test cross; i.e., crossing one fly whose genotype is to be determined with a homozygous recessive fly. If the test fly is homozygous dominant: All the progeny will show the dominant phenotype. This implies that the test fly is homozygous dominant. If the test fly is heterozygous, then in the back cross: So half the progeny will show dominant phenotype and the other half will show recessive phenotype.

{"question": "All organic matter is made up entirely or mostly of the basic elements carbon and hydrogen. In view of this, why is there such a diversity of organic compounds present?", "solution": "The diversity of organic compounds is so vast that these organic compounds have been divided into families, such as alkanes, alkynes and aromatic compounds, which have no counterparts among inorganic compounds. The tremendous variety of these compounds is made possible by the unique properties of carbon. To be able to understand how carbon can form such a huge number of compounds with a great variety of properties, the way in which the atoms in these molecules are bonded together must be looked at. Carbon has a valence number (the number of bonds an atom of an element can form) of four. This means that each carbon atom always has four bonds which can be either bonded to four other atoms, as in methane; to three other atoms, as in formaldehyde; or to 2 other atoms as in hydrogen cyanide. In other words carbon is capable of forming single, double and triple bonds: But the diversity this element possesses does not stop here. It is capable of bonding to other carbon atoms in an almost unique variety of chain and ring structures. This property is called catenation and accounts for the tremendous variety seen in the following compounds: These examples show the use of a minimum number of carbon atoms. The diversity possible is apparent when one considers the fact that these different types of bond can be joined together in infinite numbers. To exemplify this, look at the compound: As it can be seen, a multitude of different variations could be made with the only constraining factor being that carbon must have four bonds. The freedom allowed carbon is apparent when contrasted with the halogens (iodine, chlorine, bromine, and flourine) which are monovalent and thus can only form one bond, for example: H-ClBr-Br hydrochloric acidbromine Another feature of the compounds of carbon that contributes to their variety is the existence of isomers (compounds composed of the same number and kind of atoms, but with the atoms arranged differently in space). Look, for example, at the compound C_4H_10. This can exist as: Although these compounds have the same chemical formulas they have different chemical, physical and biological properties due to their arrangement in space.", "images": ["images/F01-0012_files/image002.jpg", "images/F01-0012_files/image004.jpg", "images/F01-0012_files/image006.jpg", "images/F01-0012_files/image008.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F01-0012.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The diversity of organic compounds is due to the unique properties of carbon, its ability to form single, double and triple bonds, its capability of bonding to other carbon atoms in a variety of chain and ring structures, and the existence of isomers."}

Initialization can be done anywhere within the body of the program, but it must be done before the variable appears in an expression in the program. A good place to do the initialization of the variables in a program is immediately following the DECLARE statements. A better and shorter way is to initialize the variables simultaneously as they are declared, that is, do the initial-ization in the DECLARE statement itself.

{"question": "What are the chemical and physical processes involved in transmission at the synapse?", "solution": "The nervous system is composed of discrete units, the neurons, yet it behaves like a continuous system of transmission of impulses. For this to occur, there have to be functional connections between neurons. These con-nections are known as synapses. A synapse is an anatomical-ly specialized junction between two neurons, lying adjacent to each other, where the electric activity in one neuron (the presynaptic neuron) influences the excitability of the second (the postsynaptic neuron). At the synapse, the electric impulse is transformed into a chemical form of transmission. Chemical transmission at the synapse involves the processes of neurosecretion and chemoreception. The arrival of a nerve impulse at the axon terminal stimulates the release of a specific chemical substance, which has been synthesized in the cell body and stored in the tip of the axon, into the narrow synaptic space between the ad-jacent neurons. This process constitutes neurosecretion. The chemical secreted, known as neurotransmitter, can cause local depolarization of the membrane of the postsynaptic region and thus transmit the excitation to the adjacent neuron. Chemoreception is the process in which the neurotransmitter becomes attached to specific molecular sites on the membrane of the dendrite (postsynaptic region), producing a change in the properties of the cell membrane so that a new impulse is established. The chemical transmitter, say acetylcholine, passes from the presynaptic axon to the postsynaptic dendrite by simple diffusion across the narrow space, called the synaptic cleft, separating the two neurons involved in the synapse. The synaptic clefts have been measured under the electron microscope to be about 200 \\AA in width. Diffusion is rapid enough to account for the speed of trans-mission observed at the synapse. After the neurotransmitter has exerted its effect on the postsynaptic membrane, it is promptly destroyed by an enzyme called cholinesterase. This destruction is of critical importance. If the acetyl-choline were not destroyed, it would continue its stimulatory action indefinitely and all control would be lost.", "images": ["images/F20-0524_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F20-0524.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Chemical transmission at the synapse involves the processes of neurosecretion and chemoreception."}

One refers to the combined gas law in such a case. This law can be stated: For a given mass of gas, the volume is in-versely proportional to the pressure and directly pro-portional to the absolute temperature. Stated algebrai-cally (PV/T) = K where P is the pressure, V is the volume, T is the absolute temperature, and K is a constant.

{"question": "Find the radius of the smallest Bohr orbit for the Hydrogen atom.", "solution": "The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom consists of a single electron of charge -e revolving in a circular orbit about a single proton of charge +e. The electrostatic force of attraction between electron and proton provides the centripetal force that retains the electron in its orbit (see the figure). Bohr's model assumes that the angular momentum of each orbit is re-stricted to integral multiples of Planck's constant divided by 2\\pi, L_n = n(h/2\\pi). This can be seen by considering the wave nature of the electron. In order to have a stable electronic orbit, the matter wave of the electron must be stationary around the orbit, as shown in the figure. Therefore, the orbit is an integral multiple of the wavelength (de Broglie wavelength) \\lambda = h/mv , 2\\pir_n = n\\lambda or r_n = n(h/2\\pimv) where v is the orbital velocity of the electron. This equation can also be written as r_n = (L_n/mv). The electrostatic force on the electron as it moves in the nth circular orbit, can be written as F = (mv^2/r_n) = k(e^2/r^2_n), ormv^2 r_n = ke^2. This is the centripetal force needed to keep the electron in its cir-cular orbit. Bohr's postulate for the quantization of the orbital angular momentum is L_n = mvr_n = n (h/2\\pi). Squaring both sides, we have m^2 v^2 r^2_n = n^2 (h^2/4\\pi^2).

{"question": "Compare steady-state bacterial growth with synchronous growth. How can one obtain these growth conditions?", "solution": "When bacteria are cultured in any closed system, such as a tube, flask, or tank, the pattern of growth includes four phases: lag, log, stationary, and death. However, one can set up an environment in which the bacterial population is maintained in the log (expon-ential) phase. This condition is called steady-state growth. Two devices, the turbidostat and the chemostat, are used to maintain the bacteria in a constant environ- ment and promote steady-state growth. The culture is kept at a constant volume by adding fresh media at the same rate old media is removed. This serves to provide a con-tinual replenishment of nutrients and a steady removal of any inhibitory products, maintaining the bacteria in the log phase of growth. The turbidostat involves the use of a photoelectric eye that monitors the turbidity of the culture. The turbi-dity is proportional to the density of the bacterial cells. The turbidostat maintains the turbidity at a specific con-stant value by regulating the flow rate of media (fresh input and old output). The chemostat regulates the level of growth by maintaining a constant, limiting amount of an essential nutrient and draining waste medium. This amount is just sufficient to keep the bacteria in the log phase. A steady-state growth is usually desired for experiments studying metabolism (since the log phase cells are nearly uniform in metabolic activity). Synchronous growth is irrelevant to the steady-state growth in the continuous culture of bacteria. In a popula-tion, all the bacterial cells do not normally divide at the same time (synchronous growth). If they did divide simul-taneously there would be an instantaneous periodic doubling of the bacterial population instead of the constant in-crease. One can manipulate the culture to produce synchro-nous growth but it lasts only a few generations, since some bacteria reproduce out of phase with the others. One may obtain a synchronized culture by inoculating the medium at freezing temperatures. The bacteria will metabolize slowly and become ready to divide. When the temperature is raised, they should all initiate reproduction simultaneously. An-other common method is to filter out the smallest cells of a log phase culture. Since these should be the ones that have just divided, they are rather well synchronized, and will eventually undergo division at approximately the same time.

If the molecular weight of this compound is 360 g/mole, what is its molecular formula?", "solution": "Molecular formula may be defined as the formula stating the actual number of each type atom in a particular compound. Problems of this sort are solved by assuming a sample of some convenient mass and then calculating the number of moles of each atom in this sample. Once the number of moles has been calculated for each component, these numbers are divided by the greatest common factor in order to obtain the proportions in which the various components appear in the molecule (empirical formula). From this, we check to see if the elements, in those proportions, give the actual molecular weight. If they do, we have the actual molecular formula. If they do not, we multiply by a factor until their weights do give the molecular weight. There is no error in assuming a sample of definite mass, since the size of a sampleof molecules does not affect the composition of the molecules. Assume a sample weighing 100 g. Then the masses of C, H, and O in the sample are: mass C = 69.96 % \u00d7 100 g = 69.96 g mass H = 7.83 %\u00d7 100 g =7.83 g mass O = 22.21 % \u00d7 100 g = 22.21 g We convert the mass of each element to the correspond-ing number of moles by dividing by the atomic weight of that element. Thus, we obtain the following number of moles of each element: moles C = (69.96 g) / (12.0 g/mole) = 5.83 moles moles H = (7.83 g)/ (1.01 g/mole)= 7.75 moles moles O = (22.21 g)/ (16.0 g/mole) = 1.39 moles The greatest common factor is 1.39 moles. Dividing the number of moles of each element by 1.39 moles, we obtain (moles C) / (1.39moles) = (5.83moles) / (1.39moles) \\allequal 4.2. (moles H) / (1.39moles) = (7.75moles) / (1.39moles) \\allequal 5.6. (moles O) / (1.39moles) = (1.39moles) / (1.39moles) \\allequal 1.

{"question": "What are the basic differences in themechanical arrangement of vertebrate and arthropod joints?", "solution": "The vertebrates are characterized by having an endoskeleton - a bony or cartilaginous framework lying within the body - surrounded by muscles .

The contraction of muscles in the vertebrates move one bone with respect to another. One end of the muscle is attached to one bone and the other end is attached to another bone. When the muscle contracts, one end - called the origin - remains relatively fixed while the other - called the insertion - moves. The insertion pulls along the bone to which it is attached, and bone movement results. The muscles of the arthropod lie within the skeleton and are attached to the skeleton's inner surface. Regions in which the exoskeleton is thin and flexible allow bending to occur and serve as the joints in the arthropod exoskeleton . A muscle may stretch across the joint so that its contraction will move one part on the next; or a muscle may be located entirely within one section of the body and may be attached at one end to a tough apodeme - a long, thin, firm part of the exoskeleton extending into that section from the adjoining one.

Since the electron is a charged particle traveling perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field (a field having the same value over all space), the particle will travel in a circle. To find the exact radius of this circular motion, we relate the magnetic force acting on the electron to the electron's acceleration via Newton's Second Law, F^\\ding{217} = ma^\\ding{217}. The magnetic force for a particle of charge q traveling perpendicular to a magnetic field with velocity v^\\ding{217} is F =qvB(1) Using Newton's Second Law, qvB = ma(2) Then because the motion is circular, we know that the acceleration the electron experiences is centri-petal (that is, it always points to the center of thecircle) and has the value (v^2 /R) , where v is the speed of the electron, and R is the radius of its orbit.

{"question": "We know that radiation and chemicals can cause cancer. Can viruses be a cause of cancer?", "solution": "Cancer involves an abnormality in the control of cell division and cell function. Cancer cells usually produce cell masses called tumors. These cells lack the normal control systems that shut off unwanted cell division . The factors which give cancer cells their characteristic property of unregulated growth are passed on from parent to progeny cancer cells. For this reason, it has been suggested that genetic changes occur within chromosomal DNA. These changes lead to a heritable cancer phenotype. Somatic mutations (mutations in cells that are not destined to become gametes ) may cause a cancer, if the mutation upsets a normal device controlling cell regulation. Some indication that somatic mutations can induce cancer comes from the fact that manycarcinpgens(agents that cause cancer) are also strong mutagens (agents that cause mutations.) Ultraviolet and ionizing forms of radiation are powerful carcinogens and are also highly mutagenic. Exposure of skin to ultraviolet light frequently results in skin cancer, and x-rays applied to the thyroid are associated with increased incidence of thyroidcancer.Manychemicals are also highly carcinogenic and mutagenic . For example, nitrites and nitrates by themselves cause no genetic or carcinogenic changes, but in cells they may become converted to powerful carcinogens- the nitrosamines. Nitrosamines are also known to be mutagens. Nitrates and nitrites are found in cured meats (frankfurters, bacon, ham) and are used to inhibit growth of anaerobic bacteria . In contrast to the somatic mutation proposal is the hypothesis that most cancers are induced by viruses. Viruses which produce tumors in animals are calledonco-genicviruses. While somatic mutations are suspected to cause a loss of functional genetic material, viruses are vehicles into a cell: they introduce new genetic material that may transform the cell into a cancerous type. In addition to multiplying and lysing their host cell, certain viruses can insert their chromosomes into the host chromosome. In some animal species, this process can transform the cell into a morphologically distinguishable cancer cell. At this point, the virus is in theprophagestate. Therefore, absence of detectable viruses does not provide ample evidence for or against a viral cause of a cancer. In 1911, an RNA virus, called the Rous sarcoma virus, was shown to be the causal agent of a sarcoma (a tumor of connective tissue) in chickens . Other RNA viruses cause sarcomas andleukemias (uncontrolledproliferation of leucocytes) in both birds and mammals. One group of DNA viruses causes warts on the skin of mammals. Other DNA tumor viruses is a mouse virus calledpolyomaand a monkey virus called SV 40.

{"question": "From what you have learned of the processes of heredity andevolution, how do you think new species arise with respectto mutation? Which is more important, the accu-mulationof small mutations or a few mutations with largephenotypic effects? Give the reasons for your answer.", "solution": "Most adaptive mutations produce barely distinguishable changes in thestructure and function of the organism in which they occur. On the otherhand, mutations with the potential to produce large phenotypic effects, necessary to elicit major changes in one jump, are practically alwayslethal or at least detrimental to survival. Major mutations are deleteriousbecause they constitute a great disturbance to the delicately balancedgenetic systems in which they arise. Therefore, major genotypic changesthrough mutation are not likely to be important in evolution. In contrast, the accumulation of small mutations over the course of manygenerations has significant evolutionary value. This has been supportedby fossil evidence, laboratory experiments and field studies. Evolutionary changes appear to arise as a result of many small changes thathave accumulated over time, ultimately producing a change in the compositionof a given population's gene pool. An example of this can be seenin the evolution of the orchid. The modern orchid flower, in both shapeand color, resembles the female wasp. Male wasps, thinking it is a female, are attracted to the flower and stimulated to attempt copulation. In doingso, they become coated with the sticky pollen grains of the flower andcarry them along to the next orchid. Any mutation that gave the orchid anysimilarity, however slight, to the female wasp would increase its chancesof being pollinated. Thus, such mutations would give those orchidsbearing them a selective advantage over orchids without them. The increased rate of pollination of the mutated forms, would promote the propagationof the mutant gene. It is easy to see how, over time, such mutationswould tend to be propagated and accumulate to the point where theorchid flower is today.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F27-0722.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The accumulation of small mutations over the course of many generations has significant evolutionary value."}
{"question": "Find the number of ways that two identical particles (n_i = 2) can be distributed in five states g_i = 5) according to (a) Bose- Einstein and (b) Fermi-Dirac statistics.", "solution": "(a) Bose statistics determine the number of distinct ways of placing n_i identical particles in g_i states, where the number of particles in a state is not restricted. Consider the system under consideration to be a linear array of (n_i + g_i - 1) holes into which either particles or partitions that separate the states can be inserted. Note that there are (g_i - 1) such partitions to separate the entire cell into g_i states. The remaining n_i holes which are separated into groups by these partitions, represent the distribution of the particles among the various states (see Fig. a). The number of distinct permutations of n_i particles and (g_i - 1) partitions over (n_i + g_i - 1) holes is the same as the number of distinct arrangements of n_i particles among the g_i states. Now, the number of permutations of (n_i + g_i - 1) distinguishable objects is (n_i + g_i - 1) !. But,n_i particles and (g_i - 1) partitions actually are indistinguishable and we must divide the above number by the number of permutations of n_i particles and by the number of permutations of (g_i - 1) partitions. The result gives the number of distinct arrangements. N_BE = [{(n_i + g_i - 1) !} / {n! (g_i - 1) !}] Substituting the numerical values, N_BE = [6!/(2! 4!)] = 15 Two possible distributions are shown in Fig. a. (b) In Fermi statistics a quantum state can contain only one particle. As before, we first find the number of ways of distributing n_i in distinguishable particles over g_i states. The first particle can be put in any of the g_i states, and for each choice of a state, the second particle can be put in any of the (g_i - 1) remaining states, and so on. The last particle will have (g_i - n_i + 1) possible states to choose from. The total number of configurations is g_i (g_i - 1) .... (g_i - n_i + 1) = [(g_i !)/{(g_i - n_i) !}] However, the actual indistinguishability of the particles requires that we divide out the number of identical configurations from this number. n_i particles give rise to n_i! permutations of the part-icles among themselves.

Assume that elements are stored in lexicographic order of their indices.", "solution": "(a) All conventional computers require a multidimensional array to be stored as a linear sequence of elements. The compiler must, therefore, contain a procedure that computes the actual location of an element in an array from its specification in terms of indices. The map-ping from the multidimensional array to the linear array is not unique. However, if we assume that the elements of the multidimensional array are stored in the lexicographic order of their indices, wecaysay that A(5,7,4) comes in the fourth column of the seventh row of the fifth plane of the array; i.e., it is preceded by four planes, six rows and three elements. But the FORTRAN statement DIMENSION A(10,15,7) allocates a storage area equivalent to 10 planes of 15 rows with 7 elements in each row. Each of the 10 planes, therefore; contains 15 \u00d7 7 elements. If loc(X) is the location of element A(X), then loc(5,7,4) = loc(1,1,1) + 4(15\\bullet7) + 6(7) + 3 = loc(1,1,1)+ 420 + 42 + 3 = loc(1,1,1) + 465. Hence, the displacement of the location of the element A(5,7,4) relative to the location of A(1,1,1) is 465. (b) Generalizing the reasoning of part (a), we can say that A(I,J,K) comes in the K-thcolumn of the J-throw of the I-thplane of the array, i.e., it is preceded by (I-1) planes, (J-1) rows, and (K-1) elements.

Therefore, loc(I,J,K) = loc(1,1,1) + (I-1)n_2n_3 + (J-1)n_3 + (K-1) The part played by array dimensions n_1, n_2, n_3 in storage mapping is one reason why FORTRAN (and most other programming languages) require the actual dimensions of arrays to be declared. Some compilers, e.g., the WATFIV FORTRAN compiler, generate a code that determines during execution of the program whether a reference to a subscripted variable lies out-side the declared array bounds. If it does, and were to remain undetected, the information might get recorded in locations that house other data, or even in the program itself, altering the program and, hence, its behavior Since such compilers as WATFIV are used for program testing, the increase in execution time due to these tests is well worth it.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G12-0285.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "465"}
{"question": "What is the total binding energy of _6C^12 and the average binding energy per nucleon?", "solution": "The mass of an atom, in general, is not equal to the sum of its component masses. The mass of the com-ponent parts (protons, neutrons, and electrons) is slightly greater than the mass of the atom. This difference in mass has an energy equivalent (E = mc^2), which is called the binding energy of the nucleus. Although binding energy refers to the nucleus, it is more convenient to use the mass of the whole atom in calcu-lations. Then,M_n= M -ZM_e, whereM_n, M, and M_e are the nuclear, atomic, and electron masses, respectively, and Z is the atomic number. Since a carbon 6 atom, C_6^12, is made up of 6 protons and 6 electrons (or 6 H^1 atoms) plus 6 neutrons, then the binding energy, (b.e.) can be represented as follows: b.e. =M_n+ZM_e- M b.e. for _6C^12 = 6 [mass of electron and proton (H_1) + mass of neutron] - atomic mass of _6C^12. In other words, a mass difference equation can be written in terms of whole atom masses.

{"question": "How much silver is deposited on a spoon which is plated for 20 minutes at 0.50 ampere?", "solution": "In order to check this problem, we must under-stand what happens during the electroplating process. As each silver ion migrates to the spoon, it is reduced to a metallic silver atom. All the silver ions are in a plus 1 ionized state. This means that for every electron pass-ing through the circuit, one silver ion will be turned into metallic silver and deposited. The problem then reduces to one of charge transport - as many atoms (or moles of atoms) of silver will be deposited as electrons (or moles of electrons) that pass through the circuit. We merely have to equate the two. The number of moles of deposited silver is given by the mass of the liberated silver (an unknown quantity) divided by the atomic mass of silver (107.9): Mass liberated in grams / (107.9gm / mole) To discover the amount of charge transported, and hence the number of moles transported, we use the relationship I = q / torq = It where I is current, q is charge, and t is time. Since we know that there are 96,500 coulombs of charge per mole of electrons, we can calculate the number of moles of electrons by using q / (96,500 coulombs /mole)orIt / (96,500 coulombs/mole) Equating the number of moles of silver plated, and the number of electrons which have passed through the circuit during the given time period, we have [Mass liberated in grams / (107.9gm / mole)] = [It / (96,500 coulombs / mole)] Since I = 0.50 amp and t = 20 min = 1200 sec. we have Mass / (107.9gm / mole) = (0.50 amp \u00d7 1200 sec) / (69,500 coulombs / mole) Solving, we obtain Mass = 0.671 gm, approximately", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Physics/D19-0634.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "0.671 gm"}

Given these data, calculate the change of entropy \u2206S, change of enthalpy \u2206H, and the change of energy \u2206E for the conversion of one mole of ice to liquid water at the normal melting point.", "solution": "The solution of this problem involves the ability to relate energy, free energy, entropy, and enthalpy. One must first calculate the change in entropy. You are told the entropies of both ice and water. The change in entropy is their difference or \u2206S =S_liq-S_solid= 59.94 - 37.95 = 21.99 J mol^-1 deg^-1 . To calculate the change in enthalpy at the melting point use the fact that \u2206G = 0 at the melting point of a substance. \u2206G = \u2206H -T_Mp\u2206S, where \u2206H = change in enthalpy,T_Mp= temperature of melting point in Kelvin and \u2206S = change in entropy. Since \u2206G = 0 at the melting point, \u2206H =T_Mp\u2206S. From the previous calculation, you know \u2206S.T_Mpis given. Thus, \u2206H = T\u2206S \u2206H = (273.15K) (21.99 J mol^-1 deg^-1) = 6010 J/mole. To calculate the \u2206E for the conversion of one mole of ice to liquid water at the normal melting point, employ the equation \u2206E = \u2206H - P\u2206V, where P = pressure, V = volume. \u2206H = 6010 J/mole. To determine P\u2206V, note that \u2206V isV_liq-V_solid. You are given the densities of ice and water. Recalling that density = mass/volume, and that the molecular weight (mass) of ice or water is 18.015 grams/mole, you have forV_liq: 18.015/.9998. ForV_solid, You have 18.015/.917.Therefore \u2206V =V_liq-V_solid= [(18.015 g/mole)/(.9998 g/cm^3)] - [(18.015 g/mole)/(.917 g/cm^3)] = - 1.63 cm^3 /mole = - .00163 liter/mole. Since one is asked to make these calculations for 1 mole of H_2 O, the change in volume, \u2206V, equals - .00163 liter. Because you are asked to calculate at the normal melting point, the pressure must be 1atm(by definition, the \"normal\" is considered to be under a pressure of one atm.) Therefore, P\u2206V = (1.00atm) (-0.00163 liter) = -0.00163 liter - atm. Since 1 liter -atmequals 101.3 J, P\u2206V is equal to (-0.00163 liter -atm) (101.3 J liter^-1 atm^-1) = - 0.1651 J.

{"question": "Describe the characteristic differences between the monotreme, marsupial and placental mammals.", "solution": "The class Mammalia is divided into three sub-classes: Prototheria (Monotremes), Metatheria (Marsupials), and Eutheria (placental mammals). Of these three, the mono-tremes can be considered the most primitive. They are an early offshoot of the main mammalian groups. The Marsupials and Placentials appeared at about the same time. Major characteristics of mammals include the possession of mammary glands and hair. Most mammals have sweat glands. All mammals are homeotherms. Monotremes are peculiar in that they possess mammalian as well as reptilian traits. They are classified as mammals, however, because the number of mammalian traits far exceed the number of reptilian traits. Some of the more outstanding mammalian traits include: a layer of hair covering the body and the secretion of milk by mammary glands. There are only two surviving species of monotremes: the duck-billed platypus and the spiny anteater, both of which are found in Australia. The trait that most clearly distinguishes monotremes from other groups of mammals is their ability to lay eggs. In marsupials and placentals, embryonic development occurs in the uterus of the female. The characteristic difference between the marsupials and the placentals is the time of embryonic development within the uterus. Marsupial embryos undergo a short developmental period before they leave the uterus. Embryonic development is completed in an abdominal pouch of the mother where the embryo is attached to a nipple. In contrast to this is the placentals. In this group, the embryo develops completely in the uterus of the mother.

{"question": "A chemist has a quantity of steam. He wants to determine whether or not it has been polluted with acidic mine drainage (AMD).

{"question": "What makes the blood flow throughout the body? In what part of the circulatory system does the blood flow most slowly? Why?", "solution": "Blood flow is the quantity of blood that passes a given point in the circulation in a given period of time. It is usually expressed in milliliters or liters per minute. Blood flow through a blood vessel is determined by two factors: (1) the pressure difference that drives the blood through the vessel; and (2) the vascular resistance, or impedance to blood flow. These relations can be expressed mathematically: Flow = (\\Delta Pressure / Resistance) . As the pressure difference increases, flow increases; as the resistance increases, flow decreases. The pressure difference between the two ends of the vessel causes blood to flow from the high pressure end to the low pressure end. This pressure dif-ference or gradient is the essential factor which causes blood to flow. Although the heart acts to pump the blood, it is the pres-sure difference (about 140 nun Hg in the aorta and near 0 in the vena cava at the right atrium) that is critical for blood flow. The overall blood flow in the circulation of an adult is about 5 liters per minute. This is called the cardiac output because it is the amount pumped by each ventricle of the heart per unit time. The cardiac output is determined by multiplying the heart rate and the volume of blood pumped by each ventricle during each beat (stroke volume): cardiac output = heart rate \u00d7 stroke volume. Normally the heart rate is about 70 beats per minute and the stroke volume is about 70 milli-liters per beat: CO = 70 (beats / min) \u00d7 70 (mls/ beat) = 4900 (mls/ min). The normal cardiac output is thus about 5 liters per minute. The rate of flow throughout the circulation is not constant. The rate is rapid in the arteries (about 30 centimeters per second) but falls as it moves through the arterioles. The rate is slowest in the capillaries but then increases again in thevenulesand veins. There is a physical explanation for this phenomenon. The velocity of blood flow in each type of blood vessel is inversely proportional to its total cross-sectional area. If any fluid passes from one tube to another of larger radius, the rate of flow is less in the larger tube. The rate is fastest in the aorta since it has the smallest total cross-sectional area of any vessel type (2.5 cm^2) The rate decreases in the arteries (20 cm^2) and decreases further in the arterioles (40 cm^2). The rate of flow decreases drastically in the capillaries which have a total cross-sectional area of 2500 cm^2 . Although the individual branches of the capillaries have a diameter much less than the aorta, their total cross-sectional area is much greater; therefore the rate in the capillaries is 1/1000 the rate in the aorta. The rate of flow increases in thevenules (250 cm^2) and increases further in the veins (80 cm^2). Finally, the rate increases rapidly in the vena cava where the cross-sectional area is 8 cm^2 .", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F15-0383.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Blood flow is determined by the pressure difference that drives the blood through the vessel and the vascular resistance.

After writing in the data, the Select line is connected to logic level 0. This disables all the gates so that changes in the Data-in line no longer affect the inputs to the flip-flop.

{"question": "When is a condition expression used in COBOL? Give the rules for comparison of numeric or nonnumeric items.", "solution": "Conditional Expressions: Conditional expres-sions are expressions used in situations where need of test-ing any condition arises. The outcome of a test determines the next logical step to be performed. The conditional expression reduces to a single value, \"true\" or \"false.\" The truth or falsity is determined by a relational test. This test is based on a comparison of characters. Rules of Comparison: Characters are compared and evaluated on the basis of a computer collating sequence in which the characters have a specified order of magnitude. This collating sequence varies from machine to machine. As an example, the ordering scheme of fig. 1 will be used in the following discussions. Items declared numeric in the DATA DESCRIPTION section cannot be compared with items declared to be nonnumeric. Comparison of Numeric Items: The comparison of numeric items is based on respective values of the item considered purely as algebraic values. The item length, in terms of the number of digits is not itself significant. e.g., comparison of +00003 with +03 results in an equal condition, and +01 is greater than -155. Comparison of Nonnumeric Items: For two nonnumeric items, possibly containing numeric characters, a comparison results with respect to the ordered character set. There are two cases: a) Equal Length Items: If items are of equal length, comparison proceeds by comparing characters in corresponding character positions. Starting from the high-order end, com-parison continues until either a pair of unequal characters is encountered or the lower order end of the item is reached. As an example, consider : 1ABCD and ABBD results in inequality ABBD > ABCD . 2SAM and SAM results in equality. 3NAME 1 and NAME 2 results in inequality, NAME 1 < NAME 2. b) Unequal Length Items: If the items are of unequal length, comparison proceeds as above. If the process exhausts the characters of the shorter item without detection of differ-ence, the shorter item is Less Than the longer item. e.g.,comparingABC & ABCD, every character A, B and C of the first item equals every character of the later item but due to the shorter length of ABC the result is ABC < ABC.", "images": ["images/G11-0249_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G11-0249.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Conditional expressions are used in situations where need of testing any condition arises.

{"question": "Two atoms of scandium are to combine with three atoms of oxygen. If you start with 1 gram of scandium, how much oxygen is required? Scandium has an atomic weight of 44.96 g/mole. The at. wt. of oxygen is 15.999 g/mole.", "solution": "The key to solving this problem is determining the number of moles that will be reacting. After this, one is able to calculate the mass by multiplying the atomic weight by the number of moles. Two atoms of scandium react with 3 atoms of oxygen, which is equivalent to saying 2 moles of scandium react with 3 moles of oxygen. A mole is defined as weight in grams of the substance divided by the atomic weight or molecular weight. If you start with 1 gram of scandium, then the number of moles of scandium is [(1.00 g) / (44.96 g/mole)] = .0222 moles. Since the number of moles of oxygen must be in a 3 : 2 ratio to scandium, multiply 3/2 by .0222 to determine the number of moles of oxygen that will react. .0222 = (3/2) .0333 moles of oxygen atoms.

{"question": "What is structure of a typical neuron?", "solution": "Before we get to the answer, it is important to recognize the fact that the term 'typical neuron' is rather vague. Neurons, which are the basic structural and functional units of the nervous systems of multicellular animals, show a great diversity in types. In humans, many types of neurons are present (Figure 1). Nevertheless, often three parts of a neuron can be distinguished: a cell body, an axon, and a group of processes called dendrites. Dendrites are usually rather short and numerous extensions from the cell body. They frequently branch profusely, and their many short terminals may give them a spiny appearance. When stained, they ordinarily show many dark granules. There is usually only one axon per neuron (very rarely two), and it is frequently longer than the dendrites. It may branch extensively, but unlike dendrites it does not have a spiny appearance and does not show dark granules when stained. The most fundamental distinction between dendrites and axons is that dendrites receive excitation from other cells whereas axons generally do not, and that axons can stimulate other cells whereas dendrites cannot. Thus, den-drites carry information to the cell body while axons carry information away from the cell body. Axons may be several feet long in some neurons. A bundle of many axons wrapped together by a sheath of connective tissue is what we commonly call a nerve. Each vertebrate axon is usually enveloped in a myelin sheath formed by special cells, the Schwann cells, that almost com-pletely encircle the axon. Schwann cells play a role in the nutrition of the axons, and provide a conduit within which damaged axons can grow from the cell body back to their original position. The myelin sheath is interrupted at regular intervals; the interruptions are called nodes of Ranvier. At these nodes, the myelin sheath disappears. The myelin functions in speeding up the transmission of impulses in the axon it envelopes. It is crucial to note that the myelin sheath is not a separate layer by itself. Through electron microscopy, it has been proved that the sheath is not a secretion product of the axon or Schwann cells, as was once believed, but a tightly packed spiral of the cell mem-brane of the Schwann cells. Thus the sheath is composed of the lipid from the membrane's bilayer. The nucleus and cyto-plasm of the Schwann cell are pushed aside to form the neu-rolemma. The nodes in the myelin sheath are simply the points at which one Schwann cell ends and another begins (see Figure 2). The neuronal cell body, or perikaryon, contains the nucleus and cytoplasmic organelles distributed around the nucleus. The perikaryon has well-developed endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus for manufacturing all the substances needed for the maintenance and functioning of the axon and dendrites.", "images": ["images/F20-0518_files/image002.jpg", "images/F20-0518_files/image004.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F20-0518.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "A typical neuron consists of a cell body, an axon, and a group of processes called dendrites."}

If the bricks have a speed of 6 ft/s when they reach the bricklayer, what percentage of the energy used up by the mate serves no useful purpose?", "solution": "Once the bricks leave the mate's hands, the only force which acts on them is the gravitational force. Since this produces a constant acceleration (a = - g =- 32 ft/s^2), the kinematics equation v^2 = v^2_0 - 2a (x - x_0) can be used to describe its motion. The initial velocity v_0 of the bricks is found by substituting known values in the above equation, (x - x_0 is the distance travelled by the bricks) v^2_0 = v^2 + 2g (x - x_0) = 36ft^2/s^2 + 2 \u00d7 32 ft/s^2 \u00d7 10ft =676 ft^2/s^2 .\\therefore v_0 = 26 ft/s.

Assume STP conditions.", "solution": "(a) An SO_2 molecule reacts with a water molecule to form an H_2SO_3 molecule according .to the following equation: SO_2 + H_2O + H_2SO3 However, H_2SO_3 is a diprotic acid and dissociates into 2 protons and a sulfate ion HO_2SO_3 \\rightarrow 2H^+ + SO_3^= Thus, for every mole of SO_2 consumed 1 mole of SO_3 = are produced. (b) This reaction is a typical redox reaction and the equation must be balanced using the standard rules. From the problem, one knows initially that H_2SO_3 + KMnO_4 \\rightarrowMnSO_4 + H_2SO_4 + K^+ This reaction is not balanced in terms of charge and elemental constituents. The first rule is to separate the above reaction into a reduction and an oxidation reaction. red:KMnO_4 \\rightarrow MnSO_4 + K^+ Mn is reduced from +7 to +2 state. ox:H_2SO_3 \\rightarrow H_2SO4 S is oxidized from +4 to +6 state. Next one balances the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in these reactions using OH^-, H^+, and H_2O molecules on either side of the equation depending upon whether the reaction is acidic or basic. Once the masses are balanced, electrons are used to balance charges and are placed on the appropri-ate side of the equation. Thus, red:KMnO_4 \\rightarrow MnSO_4 + K+ The potassium ion and the SO_4 ion do not play significant roles in the balancing of this equation and are therefore unnecessary. MnO^-_4 \\rightarrow Mn^+2 This reaction is acidic and therefore will be using H^+ and H_2O. 8H++ MnO^-_4 \\rightarrow Mn^+2 + 4H_2O The H2O is placed on the right to balance the in MnO^-_4; the H in H_2O is balanced on the left with H^+. equation will be balanced in terms of elements and when electrons are added.

H_2O + SO_3^= \\rightarrow SO_4^= + 2H^+ Now balance off the charge using electrons: H_2O + SO_3^= \\rightarrow SO_4^= + 2H++ 2e- Once both oxidation and reduction processes are balanced, they are added together in the following manner. red:[8H^+ + 5e-+ MnO^-_4 \\rightarrow Mn^++ + 4H_2O] \u00d7 2 ox:[H_2O + SO_3^= \\rightarrow SO_4^= + 2H++ 2e^-] \u00d7 5 These reactions are solved simultaneously to eliminate the electrons in both reactions. Thus, 16H^+ + 2MnO^-_4 \\rightarrow 2Mn^++ + 8H_20 5H_2O + 5S03^=\\rightarrow 5SO_4^= + 10H^+ Total:6H^+ + 2MnO^-_4 + 5SO_3^= \\rightarrow 2Mn^++ + 5SO_4=+ 3H_2O (c) To solve this part of the problem, one must know the number of moles of SO_2 in air is equal to the number of moles of SO_3^= that are represented in the equation for the reaction with KMnO_4. This amount is determined from the stoichiometry. For every mole of SO_2 consumed, 1 mole of SO_3^= is formed, and for every 1 mole of SO_3^= consumed, 2/5 mole of MnO^-_4 is also consumed. Thus, number moles of SO_2 = 5/2 (2.5 \u00d7 10^-5) = 6.25 \u00d7 10^-5 moles To obtain a concentration in units of ppm (parts per million), one needs to know the volume of SO_2 consumed and the total volume of air. The total volume of air is 1 \u00d7 10^3 liters. The volume of SO_2 consumed is volume of SO_2 = (6.25 \u00d7 10^-5 moles)(22.4 liter/mole) = 1.4 \u00d7 10^-3 l, since, at STP, one mole of gas will occupy 22.4 liters. Thus, the ratio of SO_2 volume to total volume of air is (1.4 \u00d7 10^-3 liter) / (1 \u00d7 103liter) = 1.4 \u00d7 10^-6. To convert this ratio into ppm, we make the denominator 10^6 liters, (1.4 \u00d7 10^-3 liter) / (1 \u00d7 103liter) \u00d7 (10^3/10^3) = (1.4) / (1 \u00d7 10^6).

Examples of such inheritance are height and skin color in man, and commercially important characteristics in animals and plants, such as the amount of eggs and milk produced, the size of fruit, and so on. In the cross between a 6-pound squash plant and a 3-pound squash plant : We are told that each dominant gene adds (1/2) pound to the weight. The presence of 3 dominant genes in F_1 (A, B, and C) would increase the weight by (1/2) + (1/2) + (1/2) or 1 (1/2) lbs. Therefore each squash from F_1 weighs 3 + 1 (1/2)or4 (1/2) pounds. In the cross between two F_1 plants, we must first determine the possible gametes from each plant. The number of possible gametes is obtained using the 2^n rule, where n is the number of heterozygous traits and 2n is the total number of different gametes formed. For each parent, n is equal to 3. Therefore the number of gametes is 2^3 or 8. The genotypes of these gametes can be obtained by dichotomous branching, which ensures that all possible combinations are considered. Each possible gene from each allelic pair is matched to every possible gene combination of the other two pairs as follows : Gametes ABC B C ABc A c AbC b C Abc c aBC B C aBc a c abC b C abc c Looking at the cross : Separating the trihybrid cross into three monohybrid crosses, and then using dichotomous branching to determine all possible combinations of the results of these crosses, one obtains: Summarizing:1/64weighs 6 pounds Summarizing:1/64weighs 6 pounds 6/64weighs 51/2 pounds 15/64weighs 5 pounds 20/64weighs 41/2 pounds 15/64weighs 4 pounds 6/64weighs 31/2 pounds 1/64weighs 3 pounds It is important to be able to associate quantitative characteristics with polygenic inheritance.

{"question": "Distinguish between copulation, insemination and fertilization.", "solution": "Copulation is the act of physical joining of two sex partners. In copulation, accessory sex organs play an important role and synchronized hormonal control is often extensively involved. Insemination is the actual process of depositing semen into the vagina. This occurs during copulation or sexual intercourse, but could also be accomplished by means of artificial injection. When copulation and insemination are complete, fertilization can occur. Fertilization is the union of the male and female gametes to produce the zygote. It should be noted that successful copulation and insemination do not guarantee that fertilization will occur. This may be due simply to the fact that the female has not ovulated and thus provided a mature ovum at the time of insemination. However, it is possible that an ovum may be present, and yet not be fertilized. For fertilization to occur, sperm must not only survive and reach the ovum, they must also succeed in penetrating it. In addition, if one or both partners are sterile, fertilization cannot take place. Sterility refers to any number of specific conditions which result in the failure to produce viable gametes. For example, sterile males may produce viable sperm, but in such low amounts that sufficient numbers do not survive in the female to insure fertilization. Sterile females may produce viable eggs but have a blockage preventing their passage from the ovaries to the oviducts or uterus.

When we pull in the string we shorten r_0 by increasing the radial force F_centrip^\\ding{217} on M. As we know, a force can only produce a torque about the axis of rotation if it has a component perpendicular to the radius which locates the mass M. A purely radial force like F_centrip^\\ding{217} has no such component, therefore the angular momentum must remain constant as the string is shortened. Mv_0r_0 = Mvr(1) The kinetic energy at r_0 is (1/2) Mv_0^2; at r it has been increased to (1/2) Mv^2 = (1/2) Mv_0^2 [r_0/r]^2 because v = v_0r_0/r from above. It follows that the work W done from outside in shortening the string from r_0 to r is W = (1/2) Mv^2 - (1/2) Mv_0^2 = (1/2)Mv_0^2 [(r_0/r)^2 - 1](2) This can also be calculated directly as the work done by F_centrip^\\ding{217} along the distance r_0 - r; W = ^r\\int_r0 F_centrip^\\ding{217} \\bullet dr^\\ding{217} = - ^r\\int_r0 F_centrip dr W = -^r\\int_r0 dr(Mv^2/r) = - ^r\\int_r0 dr(M/r) [(v_0^2r_0^2)/(r^2)] where we have used (1).

We see that the angular momentum acts on the radial motion as an effective repulsive force. We have to do extra work on the particle on bringing it from large distances to small distances if we require that the angular momentum be conserved in the process.", "images": ["images/D05-0278_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Physics/D05-0278.htm", "image_question": true, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "W = (1/2) Mv_0^2 [(r_0/r)^2 - 1]"}
{"question": "What fraction of the total space in a body-centered cubic unit cell is unoccupied? Assume that the central atom touches each of the eight corner atoms of the cube.", "solution": "To determine the percent of the unit cube that is unoccupied by the atoms making up the lattice, one must subtract the volume taken up by the atoms from the volume of the cube. This volume is then divided by the volume of the cube and multiplied by 100 to find the percent of unoccupied space. 1) Determining the volume of the atoms: One must first determine the number of atoms contributing to the unit cube.

The atom in the center contributes its entire volume. no. of atoms in unit cube = (1/8 atom / corner \u00d7 8 corners) + 1 atom (in center) = 2 atoms.

{"question": "Find the degree of ionization of 0.05 M NH_3 in a solution of pH 11.0.

Namely, \\alpha = (x/c) , where x is the number of moles of acid or base that dis-sociate and c is the original number of moles present. To solve this problem, let it first be stated that NH_3 is a base and that [OH^-] can be calculated from the pH value. The reaction equation is NH_3 + H_2O \\rightleftarrows NH_4^+ + OH^-. After obtaining [OH^-], [NH_4^+] will be the only unknown in the equilibrium constant equation, which is K_b = {[NH_4^+][OH^-]}/[NH_3] = 1.76 \u00d7 10^-5 . To find [OH^-], note thatpOH= - log [OH^-] and that pH +pOH= 14. Substituting the given value of pH, pOH= 14 - pH = 14 - 11 = 3. Thus, [OH^-] = - log 3 = 1 \u00d7 10^-3.

{"question": "Draw the general structure of an amino acid and discuss why it is both an acid and a base.", "solution": "The general structure of an amino acid can be drawn as: where R represents a side group which can be changed to create any amino acid. Note that the molecule contains two polar groups(COO^- and NH_3^+) and for this reason, amino acids are called dipolar ions or zwitterions. It is these two polar groups which give amino acids the ability to function as both acids and bases. Depending on the pH, amino acids can exist in one of three ionic forms: The pH at which most of the amino acids exist in the zwitterion (dipolar) form is called its isoelectricion point. When the pH is made more acidic, the dipolar ion is converted to the cation I. In this form, the amino acid will act as an acid with the carboxyl group capable of donating its proton. When the pH is made alkaline, the anion III is formed and predominates in solution. In this form, the amino acid will act as a base, with the amino group as the proton acceptor. At its isoelectric point, the amino acid is capable of acting as both an acid and a base, with both ionic forms existing in exact balance with each other. The relative acidity and basicity of an amino acid is strongly influenced by the structure and properties of its particular R group. In addition, the R group can itself act as an acid or base. Thus, each amino acid will have its own characteristic isoelectric point, and its own particular K_a and K_b for its amino and carboxylic acid groups. At a given pH, some amino acids will be acidic (protonated or cationic), while others will be basic (anionic), and others will be neutral (zwitterionic). At physiological pH, most amino acids exist in the dipolar form, with acidity and basicity being determined by each particular R group. In the dipolar form, however the amino acids can react with each other, via their polar groups, to form a covalent peptide linkage: This peptide bond is the means by which large protein molecules are constructed from amino acids.", "images": ["images/F01-0023_files/image002.jpg", "images/F01-0023_files/image004.jpg", "images/F01-0023_files/image006.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F01-0023.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": true, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Amino acids can function as both acids and bases due to their two polar groups (COO^- and NH_3^+)."}

The zinc wrapper serves as the electrode for the oxidation half-- cell (the anode), while the graphite rod is the electrode for the reduc-tion half-cell (the cathode). Thus, the probable half-reactions are: at the anode: Zn(s) \\rightarrow Zn2++ 2e^- and at the cathode: 2MnO_2(s) + 2H_3O^+ + 2e^- \\rightarrow 2MnO(OH) + 2H_2O . The net reaction for the overall process is Zn(s) + 2MnO_2 \\rightarrow ZnO \\bullet Mn_2O_3 . To determine how long the current can flow, calculate the number of moles of MnO_2 present and the number of Faraday's required to reduce it per mole. You are told that 20% of 25 grams of paste is MnO_2.Thus, you have (.20)(25g) = 5.0g of MnO_2 .The molecular weight of MnO_2 = 86.94g . Thus, you have (5g) / (86.94g /mole) = .0575 moles of MnO_2 . From the net equation, you see that 2 electrons are transferred. A Faraday = 96,500 coul and is capable of reducing one equivalent posi-tive charge, which means Avogardro's number of individual unit charges (one mole of electrons).

If 0.300 mole of CO is added at constant temperature, what will be the new concentrations of each component at equilibrium?", "solution": "If a stress is placed on a system in equilibrium, whereby the equilibrium is altered, that change will take place which tends to re-lieve or neutralize the effect of the added stress. Thus, in this re-action when more CO is added after equilibrium has been established more C0Cl_2 will be formed to re-establish the equilibrium. One is given the concentrations of the components at equilibrium, thus the equilibrium constant (Keq) can be calculated. The equilibrium con-stant for this reaction can be stated: Keq= [COCl_2] / {[CO] [Cl_2]} , the ratio of products to reactants, where [ ] indicate concentration. One can solve for theKeqby using the concentrations given for the first equilibrium , Keq= [COCl_2] / {[CO] [Cl_2]}[COCl_2] = 0.400 mole/liter [CO] = 0.100 mole/liter [Cl_2] = 0.500 mole/liter Keq= (0.400) / { (0.100) (0.500)} = (0.400) / (0.05) = 8.0 . One knows, from the definition ofKeq, that when more CO is added to the mixture that the concentrations of the components rearrange so that the equation forKeqis equal to 8. Using LeChatelier'sprinciple, stated in the first sentence of this explanation, one knows that when more CO is added to this mixture more COCl_2 is formed. Let new concentrations of COCl_2 = [0.400 + x] . From the equation, one knows that for each mole of C0Cl_2 formed one mole of Cl_2 is used, thus the new concentration of Cl_2 = [0.500 - x]. One mole of CO is also used for each mole of COCl_2 formed, thus the new concentration of CO will be equal to x subtracted from the sum of the number of moles originally present and the number added. The new concentration of CO = [0.100 + 0.300\\Elzbarx]. Because one knows that Keq=8, one can now solve for x. Keq= [COCl_2 ] / { [CO ] [Cl_2 ] } =8where [COCl_2 ] = (0.400 + x) moles [CO] = (0.100 + 0.300\\Elzbar x) moles [Cl_2] = (0.500\\Elzbar x) moles Solving, 8 = {0.400 + x} / {(0.100 + 0.300\\Elzbar x) (0.500\\Elzbar x)} (0.400 + x) / (0.2\\Elzbar 0.9x + x^2 ) = 8 (0.400 + x) = 8(0.2-\\Elzbar 0.9x + x^2) (0.400 + x) = (1.6 - \\Elzbar 7.2x + 8x^2) 0 = 1.2\\Elzbar 8.2x + 8x^2 .

{"question": "Many antibodies react by causing agglutination and precipitation of the antigen-antibody complex. Explain why these antibodies and their respective antigens must each have more than one binding site per molecule.", "solution": "The structure of the IgG molecule has al-ready been visualized in the electron microscope. It is a Y-shaped molecule with one binding site, or valency, at the end of each arm. Each IgG molecule is thus divalent, having two binding sites capable of combining with two antigens. Each antigen molecule also has more than one binding site; that is, it is divalent or multivalent. The reason that both antibodies and antigens are multivalent is to permit a high degree of agglutination (clumping). This allows precipitation of the antibody- antigen complex to occur. If only one binding site existed on each antibody and antigen molecule, then only one molecule of antibody could bind to one molecule of antigen: Precipitation would not occur if the complex were this small. Even if the antibody were divalent, as we know to be so, complex size would still be limited to 3 molecules if the antigen were univalent: Therefore, the antigen molecule must also be at least divalent for there to be extensive bridging of antigenantibody complexes. This large complex of antigens and antibodies, called a lattice, is now able to settle out of the body fluid.

The pressure of the liquid column is given by pressure of liquid = height or depth of column (mm) \u00d7 \\rho (g/ml) (ml/cm^3) (cm/10mm) Hence: P_1 = barometric pressure + pressure needed to depress liquid = P_atm + h_1 \u00d7 \\rho (ml / cm^3 ) cm/10mm = P_atm + 0.1 h_1 (g/cm^2) \\rho P_2 = barometric pressure + pressure needed to depress liquid (or - pressure needed to elevate liquid) = P_atm + 0 \u00d7 \\rho \u00d7 m1/cm^3 \u00d7 cm/l10mm = P_atm P_3 = barometric pressure - pressure needed to elevate liquid = P_atm - h_3 \u00d7 \\rho \u00d7 ml/cm^3 \u00d7 cm/10mm = P_atm - 0.1 h_3 (g/cm^2 ) = P_atm - 0.1 h_3 (g/cm^2 ) \\rho", "images": ["images/E02-0024_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E02-0024.htm", "image_question": true, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "P_1 = P_atm + 0.1 h_1 (g/cm^2) rho, P_2 = P_atm, P_3 = P_atm - 0.1 h_3 (g/cm^2 ) rho"}
{"question": "In a double slit interference experiment the distance between the slits is 0.05 cm and the screen is 2 meters from the slits. The light is yellow light from a sodium lamp and it has a wavelength of 5.89 \u00d7 10^-5 cm. What is the distance between the fringes?", "solution": "To find the distance between fringes in the double slit experiment, we must first derive the formulas for the location of the maxima and minima of the fringe pattern. Let us examine this experiment in more detail. Light is incident on the 2 slits from the left. (See figure) MP and AP represent 2 rays of light, one from each slit, arriving at P. Typically, L >> d, and we may con-sider MP to be equal to BP. Assuming that the light rays emerging from the slits are in phase, the two light rays arriving at P will be out of phase because light from A must travel the extra distance AB when compared with light from M. If this path difference (AB = d sin \\textphi ) is equal to an even number of half wavelengths, P will be a maximum point. If AB equals an odd number of half wavelengths, P will be a minimum point. Hence, For a maximum sin \\textphi = (2n) \\lambda/2d(n = 0, 1, 2,...) For a minimum sin \\textphi = [(2n + 1)] \\lambda/2d(n = 0, 1, 2,...) Therefore, the angular location of adjacent maxima on the screen (say the nth and (n + 1) th maxima,) is sin (\\textphi_n+1) = [{2(n + 1)\\lambda} / {2d}] = [(n + 1)\\lambda/d](1) sin (\\textphi_n) = [{(2n)\\lambda} / {2d}] = n\\lambda/d But, if \\textphi is small, sin (\\textphi_n+1) \\approx tan (\\textphi_n+1) sin (\\textphi_n) \\approx tan (\\textphi_n).

{"question": "How can you determine whether or not a given population is in genetic equilibrium?", "solution": "In an equilibrium population, both gene frequencies and genotype frequencies remain constant from generation to generation. The best way to determine if a given population is in equilibrium is to compare these frequencies of two generations to see if they are indeed constant. One way to do this is to determine the gene frequencies for a given adult population representative (or a group of that population) and for their offspring. Two generations are thus represented in the sample. For more reliable results, however, more generations should be compared with respect to their gene frequencies. Suppose one wanted to know if the population of Australian aborigines were in genetic equilibrium. Data from that population concerning the distribution of MN blood groups are gathered, and are shown below: Phenotype Generation (G) M MN N Total 1 241 604 195 1040 2 183 460 154 797 MN blood groups are determined by two alleles, L^M and L^N , having intermediate or codominant inheritance. Thus M type is coded for by L^ML^M, MN type by L^ML^N, and N type by L^NL^N. We can calculate the genotype frequencies using the data given: Genotype Frequency G_1 G_2 L^ML^M 241 / 1040 = .231 183 / 797 = .230 L^ML^N 604 / 1040 = .581 460 / 797 = .577 L^NL^N 195 / 1040= .188 154 / 797 = .193 1.0 1.0 The genotype frequencies are thus found to be essentially the same for both generations. We could also have determined the allelic frequencies from the data, the number of L^M alleles in the population is twice the number of M individuals (L^ML^M) plus the number of MN individuals (L^ML^N). The number of L^N alleles is twice the number of N individuals plus the number of MN individuals. Since each individual carries two alleles, the total number of alleles in the population is twice the number of individuals, or the sum of the L^M and L^N alleles. For our population, then, we have the following: L^M = 2(M) + MN L^M = 2(M) + MN G_1 2(241) + 604 = 1086 2(195) + 604 = 994 G_2 2(183) + 460 = 826 2(154) + 604 = 768 Total Alleles(L^M+L^N) Frequency L^M Frequency L^N G_1 1086+994=2(1040)=2080 1086/2080=.522 994/2080 = .478 G_2 826+768=2( 797)=1594 826/1594=.518 768/1594 = .482 As with the genotype frequencies, the allelic frequencies remain nearly the same in both generations. Thus we can say that, with respect to the MN blood group alleles, the population is in equilibrium. Note that we can only determine equilibrium in a population in reference to a given gene or a small number of genes. Though our population may be in equilibrium for the MN alleles, other allelic systems may not be. For example, migration may be occurring from nearby populations having similar MN allelic frequencies but very different allelic frequencies for color blindness, thus affecting the equilibrium of these genes in the population.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F26-0699.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The best way to determine if a given population is in equilibrium is to compare the gene frequencies and genotype frequencies of two generations to see if they are constant."}
{"question": "A laser emits a monochromatic light beam, of wavelength \\lambda, which falls normally on a mirror moving at velocity V. What is the beat frequency between the incident and reflected light?", "solution": "When a source of light is in motion relative to an observer or vice versa, the light waves exhibit a change in frequency as seen by that observer. This phenomenon is known as the Doppler effect, and the Doppler shift for light is given as v_observed= v\\surd[(c \\pm v) / (c \\mp v)](1) where v is the frequency of the light in an inertial frame of refer-ence, v is the speed of the source relative to the observer, and c is the speed of light. In this problem v is the speed of the mirror. Let us choose the mirror to be moving away from the laser, so that it absorbs the light as if it were an observer moving away at speed v; it then re-emits the light as if it were a source moving away at speed v. In both cases the source and observer are separating from one an-other, so the frequency decreases. To get v_observed, < v = we need the lower signs in equation (1). Now, when the mirror absorbs the light, we have v_absorved= v\\surd[(c - v) / (c + v)](2) Similarly, when it re-emits the light, the frequency shift is given by v_emitted=v_absorved\\surd[(c - v)/(c + v)] = v[(c - v)/(c + v)].(3) The beat frequency is the difference in frequencies between the in-cident and reflected light: v_beat= v -v_emitted v_beat= v - v[(c - v) / (c + v)] = v[1 - {(c - v) / (c + v)}] = v[2v / (c+ v)] v_beat= c / \\lambda[2v / (c+ v)] when v << c, then c + v \\cong c.

{"question": "A man hangs from the midpoint of a rope 1 m long, the ends of which are tied to two light rings which are free to move on a horizontal rod (see the figure). What is the maximum possible separation d of the rings when the man is hanging in equilibrium, if the relevant co-efficient of static friction is 0.35?", "solution": "Since the man hangs from the midpoint of the rope, by symmetry the tensions in the two portions of the rope must be equal and have magnitude T, and each portion will be inclined at the same angle \\texttheta to the vertical. Thus the system of forces acting on each ring will be the same. Now consider one of the rings. Three forces are acting on it: the tensional pull on the ring due to the rope, the normal force exerted upward by the rod, and the frictional force attempting to prevent motion of the ring toward its fellow. Since the ring is light, its weight may be ignored. If the ring is too far out, slipping will occur. At the maximum distance apart, each ring is just on the point of slipping. Hence F = \\mu_sN.

{"question": "Indicate the equilibrium equation and constant expression for theautoprotolysisof liquid ammonia. If KNH_3 = 10^-22 , how many molecules of ammonia are ionized in 1 mole of ammonia? Assume a density of 0.771g/ml for ammonia.", "solution": "Autoprotolysisis that phenomenon whereby an ammonia molecule can donate a proton to another NH_3 molecule to form posi-tive and negative charged species. The equation of theautoprotolysiscan be written NH_3 + NH_3 \\rightleftarrows NH+_4 + NH^-_2 or (i) 2NH_3 \\rightleftarrows NH+_4 + NH^-_2 . To find the constant expression, consider the equilibrium con-stant expression for the reaction: K = [{(NH+_4) (NH-_2)}/{(NH_3)^2}] . Note, though, that the concentration of NH_3 in pureamnoniais always constant. By analogy with theautoprotolysisof water (where the K_W expression is written [OH^-] [H_3O^+] - without [H_2O]^2 in the denominator), the constant expression for theautoprotolysisof NH_3 is (ii) K_NH3 = [NH+_4] [NH-_2] . To find the number of molecules of ammonia ionized in 1 mole of ammonia, use the equation K = [{(NH+_4) (NH-_2)}/{(NH_3)^2}] . Let x be the number of moles of ammonia ionized. Then the NH_3 remainingnonionizedis 1-x moles. Since each 2 ammonia molecules must ionize to produce one NH+_4 and one NH-_2 , the number of NH+_4 = number of NH^-_2 = (x/2). Let V be the volume of one mole of ammonia. The concentration of NH^+_4 and NH-_2 can be rewritten as [(x/2)/V], and the concentration ofnonionizedNH_3 is [(1 - x)/V] . The equation for K can be rewritten as (iii)K = [({(x/2)/V} {(x/2)/V})/({(1 - x)/V}^2)] = [(x^2/4)/{(1 - x)^2}] \\textbullet [(1/V^2)/ (1/V^2)] = [(x^2)/{4(1 - x^2)}] . x, the number of moles of ionized ammonia, can be calculated if K is known. To solve for K , consider a more general case of the equation K = [{[NH+_4] [NH-_2]}/{[NH_3]^2}] . The numerator [NH^+_4] [NH-_2] is the constant expression for the auto-protolysisof NH_3 and must always equal K_NH3 \\textbullet K_NH3 is given as 10^-22. To find [NH_3]^2 , use the fact that the density of ammonia is 0.771g/ml. The mole weight of ammonia is 17.03g. Thus, 0.771g is [(0.771g)/(17.03g/mole)] = 0.0453 moles of ammonia; and the density of ammonia is 0.0453 moles/ml. = 45.3 moles/liter. Thus, [NH_3] = 45.3M. Substitute these results in K = [{[NH^+_4] [NH-_2]}/{(NH_3)^2}] (iv)K = (10^-22/45.3^2) = 4.9 \u00d7 10^-26 . Substitute this value of K into (iii) (v)4.9 \u00d7 10^-26 = [(x^2)/{4(1 - x^2)}] . To simplify the problem, note that the dissociation of ammonia is very small and thus x << 1. Thus, approximate 1-x^2 as 1. Then, (v) becomes (vi)(x^2/4) = 4.9 \u00d7 10^-26 .

{"question": "Outline briefly the events occurring in each stage of meiosis. Illustrate your discussion with diagrams if necessary.", "solution": "Meiosis is the process by which diploid organisms (having two sets of chromosomes) produce haploid gametes (having only one set of chromosomes). When two gametes fuse in fertilization, the zygote formed will thus have the full diploid chromosomal complement. Meiosis consists of two cell divisions, the first (Meiosis I) called a reduction division, and the second (Meiosis II) a mitotic type division. Interphase I:This phase is similar to mitotic interphase The cell appears inactive in reference to cell division; but it is during interphase that chromosome duplication occurs. Prophase I:The chromosomes become thicker and more visible. While they are still long thin threads, an attractive force (as yet not identified) causes homologous chromosomes to come together in pairs, a process known as synapsis. This is the stage during which cross-over between homologous chromosomes will occur. After synapsis, the chromosomes continue to shorten and thicken; their double nature becomes visible, so that each homologous pair appears as a bundle of four chromatids called a tetrad. Each tetrad is composed of two doubled homologous chromosomes. The number of tetrads is thus equal to the haploid number. The cent-romeres of homologous chromosomes are connected, and there are thus two centromeres for the four chromatids. While these events are occurring, the centrioles migrate to opposite poles, the spindle begins to form between them, and the nucleolus and nuclear membrane dissolve. The tetrads move to the equatorial plane of the spindle. Metaphase I:Migration to the equatorial plane is complete, and the nuclear membrane and nucleolus have dissolved. Anaphase I:At this point the homologoues chromosomes that had paired in prophase separate and move to opposite poles of the cell. Each is still composed of two identical daughter chromatids joined at the centromere. Thus the number of chromosome types in each resultant cell is reduced to the haploid number. Telophase I:Cytoplasmic division occurs as in mitosis. Meiosis I concludes and meiosis II begins. There is no definable interphase between the two series of divisions. The chromosomes do not separate or duplicate, nor do they form chromatin threads. Prophase II:The centrioles that had migrated to each pole of the parental cell, now incorporated in each haploid daughter cell, divide, and a new spindle forms in each cell. The chromosomes move to the equator. Metaphase II:The chromosomes are lined up at the equator of the new spindle, which is at right angles to the old spindle. Anaphase II:The centromeres divide and the daughter chromatids, now chromosomes, separate and move to opposite poles. Telophase II:Cytoplasmic division occurs. The chromo-somes gradually return to the dispersed form and a nuclear membrane forms. The two meiotic divisions yield four cells, each carrying only one member of each homologous pair of chromosomes.

{"question": "Discuss the excretory system of planaria.", "solution": "The excretory system of planaria involves a network of tubules running the length of the body on each side. These highly-branching tubules open to the body surface through a number of tiny pores. Side branches of the tubules end in specialized cells called flame cells (see Figure), also referred to as protonephridia. Each flame cell consists of a hollow, bulb--shaped cavity containing a tuft of long, beating cilia. It is very probable that flame cells function primarily in the regulation of water balance. The presence of better developed flame cells in freshwater species lends support to the osmoregulatory function of these cells. Primarily, water, and some waste materials, move from the tissues into the flame cells. The constant undulating movement of the cilia creates a current that moves the collected liquid through the excretory tubules to the nephridiopores, through which it leaves the body. The motion of the cilia resembles a flickering flame, hence this type of excretory system is often called a flame-cell system. Most metabolic wastes move from the body tissues into the gastrovascular cavity, and from there they are eliminated to the outside through the mouth. Nitrogenous wastes are excreted in the form of ammonia via diffusion across the general body surface to the external aquatic environment.", "images": ["images/F11-0283_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F11-0283.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The excretory system of planaria involves a network of tubules running the length of the body on each side, ending in specialized cells called flame cells or protonephridia, which function primarily in the regulation of water balance."}
{"question": "The total speed of a projectile at its greatest height v_1, is \\surd(6/7) of its total speed when it is at half its greatest height, v_2. Show that the angle of projection is 30\\textdegree.", "solution": "When a particle is projected as shown in the figure i the component of the velocity in the x- direction stays at all times the same, v_x = v-_0 cos \\texttheta_0, since there is no acceleration in that direction, owing to the fact that there is no horizontal component of force acting on the projectile. In the y-direction, the upward velocity is initially v_0 sin \\texttheta_0 and gradually decreases, due to the acceleration g acting downward. At its greatest height h, the upward velocity is reduced to zero. The kinematic relation for constant acceleration which does not involve time is used to find the greatest height of the trajectory. It is v^2_f = v^2_i + 2as(1) In this case v_f = 0, v_i, the initial velocity, is v_0 sin \\texttheta_0, a = - g and s = h. Then 0 = (v_0 sin \\texttheta_0)^2 - 2gh orh = [(v_0 sin \\texttheta_0)^2]/2g. The total velocity at the highest point is thus the x-component only. That is, v_1 = v_0 cos \\texttheta_0. At half the greatest height, h/2 = (v_0 sin \\texttheta_0)^2/4g, the velocity in the y-direction, v_y, is obtained from the equation (1) with v_f = v_y, v_i = v_0 sin \\texttheta_0, a = -g, and s = h/2. v^2_y2 = (v_0 sin \\texttheta)^2 - 2g (h/2) = (v_0 sin \\texttheta)^2 - (1/2) (v_0 sin \\texttheta)^2 = (1/2) (v_0 sin \\texttheta)^2.(2) In addition, there is also the ever-present x- component of the velocity v_0 cos \\texttheta_0.

{"question": "Design an experiment which would select for a nutritional mutant .", "solution": "Organisms possess structures called genes which determine their characteristics . A gene is capable of changing, or mutating, to a different form so that it determines an altered characteristic. Any organism that has a specific mutation is called a mutant. Among the large variety of bacterial mutants are those which exhibit an increased tolerance to inhibitory agents such as antibiotics. There are also mutants that exhibit an altered ability to produce some end product, and mutants that are nutritionally deficient (unable to synthesize or utilize a particular nutrient.) These nutritional mutants are calledauxotrophsbecause they require some nutrient not required by the original cell type or prototroph. The first step in isolating a nutritional mutant is to increase the spontaneousmutation rate of the bacteria, which usually ranges from 10^\\rule{1em}{1pt}6 to 10^\\rule{1em}{1pt}10 bacterium per generation.(This means that only 1 bacterium in 1 million to 1 in 10 billion is likely to undergo a mutational change.) The mutationrate can be significantly increased by exposing a bacterial culture (e.g. Escherichia coli), to ultraviolet radiation or x-rays. A portion of the irradiatedE.coliculture is placed on the surface of a Petri dish, and spread over the surface to ensure the isolation of colonies. This Petri dish must contain a \"complete\" medium, such as nutrient agar, so that all bacteria will grow, including the nutritional mutants . Nutrient media contain all the essential nutrients needed for growth . After incubation of this \"complete\" medium plate, the exact position of the colonies on the plate is noted. A replica plating device is then gently pressed to the surface of the complete plate, raised, and then pressed to the surface of a \"minimal\" media plate. A replica plating device consists of a sterile velveteen (a cotton fabric woven like velvet) cloth. Cells from each colony adhere to the cloth in specific locations so that each colony remains isolated. These cells serve as aninoculumwhen the cloth is pressed to another plate. The replica plating devicetranfersthe exact pattern of colonies from plate to plate. The positioning of the cloth on the \"minimal\" agar plate must be identical to its positioning when originally pressed to the complete plate. Colony locations will then be comparable on each of the two plates, which are termed \"replicas.\" The \"minimal\" medium consists only of glucose and inorganic salts, which are nutrients which normally permit the growth ofE.coli. From these basic nutrients , normalE. colican synthesize all required amino acids, vitamins, and other essential components. After incubation, colonies appear on the minimal plate at most of the positions corresponding to those on the complete plate. Those missing colonies on the minimal plate are assumed to be nutritional mutants, becausethey cannot grow on a glucose inorganic salts medium. These missingcolonies can be located on the complete media plate by comparing the location of colonies on the replicas. If they had not been irradiated , and if mutations did not occur, all the colonies would have been able to grow on this minimal medium. The colonies that did grow were not affected by the irradiation, and were non-mutants. To determine the exact nutritional deficiency of theauxotrophs, one can plate them on media which contain specific vitamins or amino acids in addition to glucose and inorganic salts. These compounds are normally synthesized byprototrophicE. coli. The mutation might have affected a gene which controls the formation of an enzyme which, in turn, regulates a stepin the biosynthesis of one of these nutrients. By plating the mutant on several plates with each plate containing an additional specific nutrient, wecould determine which nutrient the mutant cannot synthesize.

{"question": "How does the wing shape of a bird correlate with its distinctive flight?", "solution": "The shape of a wing is correlated with both the power and type of flight for which it is used. Long, slender, pointed wings, sometimes reaching beyond the tail, are seen in birds having great flying powers and soaring habits, such as gulls, eagles, hawks, and vultures.

These are habitual ground dwellers with feet adapted for running. They occasionally make short powerful flights by rapid wing strokes. Degeneration of the wings to a flightless condition has occurred in a number of birds, such as the penguins and the ostriches.

Assume that lattice vacancies are the only defects.", "solution": "The key to solving this problem is to compute the theoretical density of the unit cell from its X-ray determined cubic edge length. Then, compare this value with the actual density to find the percent of the sites that would appear to be empty. Theoretical density = mass of 1 unit cell / volume of 1 unit cell Each unit cell possesses 4 ions of each Ag^+ and Cl^-. This is determined from the fact that each corner ion contributes 1/8 of its volume to each of 8 adjacent unit cells, each face ion contributes 1/2 of its volume to the two adjacent cells, each edge ion contributes 1/4 of its volume to each of 4 adjacent cells and each enclosed ion contributes its entire volume. As seen in the accompany-ing figure, there are 8 corner ions, 12 edge ions, 6 face ions and 1 totally enclosed ion. The molecular weight of AgCl is 143.32. Thus, the mass of 1 mole of unit cells is 4 times 143.32 g/mole of unit cells or 573.28 g/mole of unit cells. Since the unit cell is a cube, volume = (cubic-edge length)^3 . Cubic edge length = .55491 nm or .55491 \u00d7 10^-7 cm. Thus, volume becomes equal to (.55491 \u00d7 10^-7)^3 = 1.708 x 10^-22 cm^3 .

{"question": "With the aid of a diagram, describe the structures found in the human ear.", "solution": "Three parts of the human ear can be distinguished: the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of the skin- covered cartilaginous flap, or pinna, and a channel known as the external auditory meatus. At the inner end of this canal is a membrane called the tympanic membrane (eardrum). On the other side of the tympanic membrane is a small chamber, the middle ear, which contains three tiny bones. These three bones are the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil) and stapes (stirrup) and are arranged in sequence across the middle ear from the tympanic membrane to another membrane, the oval window, which separates the middle ear from the inner ear. The middle ear is connected to the pharynx via the Eustachian tube, which serves to equalize the air pressure between the outer and middle ear. The inner ear consists of a complicated labyrinth of interconnected fluid-filled chambers and canals. One group of chambers and canals is involved with the sense of equilibrium. There are two small chambers - the sacculus and utriculus - and three semicircular canals arranged perpendicularly to one another. The utricle and saccule are small, hollow sacs lined with sensitive hair cells and containing small ear stones, or otoliths, made of calcium carbonate. The semicircular canals contain hair cells and are filled with a fluid known as the endolymph. Movement of the endolymph over the hair cells stimulates the latter to send impulses to the brain. Besides the structures involved in maintaining equilibrium, the inner ear also houses the organ for hearing, the cochlea. The cochlea is a coiled tube made up of three canals - the vestibular canal, the tympanic canal and the cochlear canal, each separated from each other by thin membranes. The oval window is linked to the vestibular canal while the tympanic canal is sealed by a membrane, the round window, which leads to the middle ear. These two canals are connected with each other at the apex of the cochlea and are filled with a fluid known as the perilymph. The cochlear canal, filled with endolymph, contains the actual organ of hearing, the organ of Corti. The organ of Corti consists of a layer of epithelium, the basilar membrane, on which lie five rows of specialized receptor cells extending the entire length of the coiled cochlea. Each receptor cell is equipped with hairlike projections extending into the cochlear canal. Overhanging the hair cells is a gelatinous structure, the tectorial membrane, into which the hairs project. The hair cells of the organ of Corti initiate impulses via the fibers of the auditory nerve to the brain.", "images": ["images/F20-0500_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F20-0500.htm", "image_question": true, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The human ear consists of the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear.

{"question": "How does a worker bee communicate to other bees the distance and direction of food from the hive?", "solution": "After one bee has discovered a food source, many bees soon appear. The first bee must somehow communicate to the others the location of the new food source. It has been determined that when a worker bee discovers food, it returns to the hive, feeds several other bees, and performs a dance on the surface of the honeycomb. If the food source is near the hive, the bee performs a \"round\" dance. This consists of a re-peating pattern of circling, first to the right and then to the left: The round dance excites the hive mates in the dancer's vicinity and they soon leave the hive in search of the food. This dance does not indicate direction or exact distance. It simply indicates that the food source is a short distance away. With increasing distance of the source from the hive, the round dance is gradually transformed into a \"waggle\" dance, which gives information about distance and direction. In the waggle dance, the bee repeatedly runs in a figure- eight pattern, wagging its abdomen from side to side as it traverses the \"waist\\textquotedblright of the figure eight: The number of turns per unit time is inversely proportional to the distance of the food source. The faster the bee runs (or turns), the closer the food source. For honey-bees, an estimate of distance is based on the amount of energy expended traveling the round trip. When conditions exist such as headwinds, uphill flights, clipped wings, or added weight to the bees, excessive distances will be reported. The waggle dance also indicates direction. The location of the food relative to the sun is indicated by the direction of the straight portion of the waggle dance. For instance, if the bee runs straight up the vertical comb, the food lies in the direction of the sun; if it runs down, the food is found in the opposite direction from the sun. A straight run at an angle indicates that the food source is to be found at that angle to the sun. Therefore a run 30\\textdegree to the left of vertical indicates a food source 30\\textdegree to the left of the sun. (See figure 3) If the bee should perform the waggle dance on a horizontal surface outside the hive, it simply dances in the direction of the food source relative to the sun. Waggle dance of bees: B and C show the same dance, performed inside and out-side the hive respectively, for locating the same food source in A.", "images": ["images/F31-0798_files/image002.jpg", "images/F31-0798_files/image004.jpg", "images/F31-0798_files/image006.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F31-0798.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "A worker bee communicates to other bees the distance and direction of food from the hive by performing a dance on the surface of the honeycomb.

{"question": "If it takes 30.3 KJ/mole of heat to meltNaCl, calculate the melting point ofNaCl, assuming the entropy increase is 28.2 J mol^-1 deg^-1.", "solution": "To solve this problem, relate free energy, enthalpy, and entropy. The formula, \u2206G = \u2206H - T\u2206S, does this. \u2206G = free energy, \u2206H = enthalpy, T = tem-perature in Kelvin and \u2206S = entropy. Let T = the melting point of NaCl . Entropy is a measure of randomness. Re-actions are favored that increase the randomness of the system. Reactions will also be favored that proceed to a lower energy state. Above the melting point, randomness increases, but so does energy. However, randomness pre-dominates, and so that solid melts, when the temperature is greater than the melting point. The situation below the melting point is exactly the opposite; here the energy consideration predominates. Only at the melting point, or when the solid and liquid are in equilibrium, will \u2206H and T\u2206S be equal. As such, at the melting point \u2206G = 0.

{"question": "A cattle breeder wants to establish a pure-breeding herd of roan short-horned cattle. What could you tell him about his chances for success in such a venture?", "solution": "Using information obtained in the previous problem we can determine if it is possible to establish a pure-breeding line of roan cattle. Roan short-horned cattle are heterozygotes. Since they have both codominant genes (the gene for red color and the gene for white color) it is impossible for them to ever breed pure. To illustrate this, let us look at the results of a mating between a roan cow and bull. Let R represent the gene for red color and W represent the gene for white color. Red cattle have the genotype RR. White cattle have the genotype WW. Roan cattle, because their color results from equal contribution of both red and white, have the genotype RW. If we mate two roan cattle: We see that one red and one white individual will be produced for every two roan individuals. Therefore, a cattle breeder might get twice as many roan cattle than red or white, but he can never be assured of having a pure-breeding herd of roan cattle. If the breeder would settle for having large numbers of roan cattle within his herd, he could continue to mate roan cattle together, but now, whenever red or white cattle are produced, mate them to each other.

{"question": "Define and compare asexual reproduction with sexual reproduction in animals. Give examples.", "solution": "The fundamental difference between asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction is the number of parents involved in the production of offspring. In asexual reproduction only a single parent is needed. Offspring identical to the parent are produced when the parent splits, buds, or fragments. Asexual reproduction typically occurs in animals such as Euglena,Paramecium,Amoeba,Hydra, flatworms, and starfish. Two parents are usually involved in sexual repro-duction. A fertilized egg is produced through the union of specialized sex cells (egg and sperm) from each parent. Instead of having traits identical to a parent, the off-spring possess a variety of recombined traits inherited from both parents. In higher animals such as man, sexual reproduction is the most common form. It must be noted that in some cases, sexual repro-duction can take place with a single parent. In the hermaphroditic worms, such as the earthworm and the fluke, both male and female sex organs occur in the same individual. Whereas self-fertilization is avoided in the earthworm by certain adaptive mechanisms, it does take place in the parasitic fluke.

{"question": "Why are organ transplants generally unsuccessful?", "solution": "Under normal circumstances, if a piece of skin, or some organ such as the heart or kidney, is trans-planted from one person to another, it initially appears to be accepted. But within two weeks, the graft (trans planted tissue) is invaded by white blood cells and the tissue dies. This graft rejection is an immunological reaction, also known as a primary set reaction. Second grafts from the same donor are rejected within a few days. This accelerated rejection is termed the second set reaction and can be explained on the basis of theclonalselection theory. Althoughhumoral(circulating) antibodies may be involved in the rejection of transplanted tissues and organs, the active agents are intact small lymphocytes.Immunoglobulinson the surface of these lymphocytes form a complex with the surface antigens on the foreign tissue cells. These lymphocytes specifically destroy these cells by secreting toxic substances or by stimulating increasedphagocyticactivity of macrophages. This immunological response is a reflection of the ability of the body's cells (self) to recognize and destroy anything that is foreign (unself). The rejection of tissue from another member of a different species is termed a heterograft reaction.Heterograftsare usually unsuccess-ful. When the donor is a member of the same species, the transplantation, called a homograft, is also usually un-successful. But when the donor and recipient are either identical twins or members of the same purebred strain, the transplantation is usually successful. These trans plants, calledisografts, are successful because the donor and recipient are genetically very similar. The genes that determine the antigens responsible for the trans-plantation immunological response are termed histocompati-bility genes. The greater the number ofhistocompatibility genes that the donor and recipient, have in common, the greater the probability that the transplant will be successful. That is whyautografts, or tissue transplants from one location to another on the same individual, are usually successful. The success ofhomograftsdepend on how well the donor's and recipient's tissues are matched, that is, how well the donor and recipient resemble each other genetically. Sometimes certain tissues of an individual's own body may be rejected, resulting in disease. The immuno-logical mechanism for distinguishing between self and non-self becomes disrupted and the body begins to destroy itself.

{"question": "Design an experiment to demonstrate that florigen, the flowering hormone, is indeed produced in the leaves and travels to the flower bud. 12 hrs per day - change to flower - inducing conditions 18 hrs per day - change to flower - inhibiting conditions A \\rightarrow a B \\rightarrow b C \\rightarrow c D \\rightarrow d", "solution": "To demonstrate that florigen is indeed produced in the leaves, a flowering plant is defoliated and then exposed to appropriate conditions under which flowering normally occurs. The observation that the plant fails to flower indicates that florigen must have been produced in the leaves, and that florigen has been removed as a result of defoliation. A control experiment must of course be set up to show that defoliation of the plant produces no adverse effect on the plant. It is postulated that in order to exert its effect on the buds, florigen must be transported from the leaves to the flower buds. This can be tested by defoliating the lower part of a plant and exposing it to flower inhibiting factors, while maintaning the upper, leafy part under flower-promoting conditions. The leafy part is found to flower as expected. Flowering in the lower part, however, can best be explained by the diffusion of florigen from the leaves of the upper part to the buds of the lower part of the plant. The defoliated lower part of the plant can never flower on its own because of the absence of florigen. Because flowers do appear on the defoliated part of the plant, it is concluded that florigen is a diffusible sub-stance made in leaves. Even more compelling evidence for this conclusion comes from grafting experiments. One can grow two plants, one plant exposed to flowering conditions, the other not. The plant exposed to flowering conditions will flower (fig. 1a). The flowering plant is now grafted onto the non-flowering plant, and a partition is used so that the grafted portion continues to be exposed to flowering conditions and the non-flowering plant to flower-inhibiting conditions (fig. 1b). Gradually, the non-flowering plant will begin to produce flowers, usually at the point nearest the graft (fig. 1c) and eventually throughout the entire plant (fig. 1d). If one were to graft a short-day plant onto a long-day plant, and expose both to a short-day period, the short-day graft induces flowering in the long-day plant (fig. 2a). Likewise, one can expose both to a long- day period, and both portions will flower, the short-day portion having been induced by the long-day portions (fig. 2b) . Similar results can be obtained using day- neutral plants. Thus florigen appears to be physiologically equivalent in the three groups of flowering plants. Graft-induced flowering is successful only if there is a living tissue connection between the two plants. In addition, flower-induction is inhibited if one removes the phloem containing tissue in the graft. This supports the conclusion that florigen is transported via the phloem system of the plant. Some plants cannot be induced to flower by the above methods unless they are first defoliated. This suggests that, under flower- inhibiting conditions, some inhibiting substance may be produced by the leaves. Flowering may thus involve the interaction of both inducing and inhibiting factors.", "images": ["images/F09-0239_files/image002.jpg", "images/F09-0239_files/image004.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F09-0239.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Florigen is produced in the leaves and transported to the flower buds, as evidenced by defoliation experiments and grafting experiments."}

{"question": "Define a genetic mutation. After a mutation has occurred in a population, what events must occur if the mutant trait is to becomeestablished in the population?", "solution": "A genetic mutation occurs as a change in a specific point (allele) or segmentof a chromosome.

Because geneticmutations occur in the chromosomes and are therefore inherited, theyare also referred to as the ultimate raw materials of evolution. When a mutation first appears, only one or very few organisms in thepopulation will bear the mutant gene. The mutation will establish itself inthe population only if the mutants survive and breed with other membersof the population. In other words, the mutants must be able to reproduce.

A mole is defined as weight in (grams / mo-lecular weight) (MW) . From this, you use the fact that in one mole of any substance, (6.02 \u00d7 10^23) molecules (Avogadro's number) exist. The lipid content is given as 2%. If the total weight of the cell is (2 \u00d7 10^-12) g, the lipid molecules must have a total weight of (.02) (2 \u00d7 10^-12) or 4 \u00d7 10^-14 grams.

The volume of a cylinder can be found from the product of its length and the area of its base. The area of the base, a circle. is \\pir^2 , where r = radius.

The weight of one liter of the solution can be calculated by multiply-ing the density by the conversion factor 1000 ml/1 liter. weight of 1 liter of the solution = 1.39 g/ml \u00d7 1000 ml/liter = 1390 g/l. weight of the water in a one liter solution = weight of the total solution - weight of 7 moles of H_2SO_4 7 moles of H_2SO_4 weigh 7 times the molecular weight of H_2SO_4 . weight of 7 moles of H_2SO_4 = 7 \u00d7 98 g = 686 g. Hence, weight of the water = 1390 g - 686 g = 704 g. The number of moles of H_2O is found by dividing its weight by the molecular weight of H_2O. no. of moles of H_2O = [(704 g)/(18 g/mol] = 39 moles The number of moles of both components of the system is now known, therefore, the mole fraction of H_2SO_4 can be obtained. mole fraction H_2SO_4 = [(moles of H_2SO_4)/(moles of H_2SO_4 + moles H_2O)] mole fraction of H_2SO_4 = [7 / (7 + 39)] = 0.15.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E08-0292.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "0.15"}
{"question": "Explain the general meaning of assembler and its basic Explain the general meaning of assembler and its basic func-tions.", "solution": "An assembler is a program that accepts a symbolic language and produces its binary machine language equiva-lent. The input symbolic program is called the source pro-gram and the resulting binary program is called the object program. The assembler is a program that operates on char-acter strings and produces an equivalent binary interpre-tation. An assembler must know the arrangment of the char-acters in memory so it can distinguish between symbols and lines. The symbolic program constitutes the input data for the assembler. Now we shall see how a two pass assembler translates the symbolic program of the previous problem. First Pass: A two pass assembler scans the entire sym-bolic program twice. During the first pass, it generates a table that correlates all user defined address symbols with their binary equivalent value. The binary translation of the program is done during the second pass. In order to keep track of the location of instructions, the assembler uses a memory word called location counter (LC). The ORG pseudo instruction initializes the LC to the value of the first location; in case ORG is missing LC is set to 0 initially. The tasks performed by the assembler during the first pass are described in the flow chart of Fig. 1. LC is initially set to 0. A line of symbolic code is scanned to see if it has a label (by presence of comma).If the line of code has no label, the assembler checks in the instruction field. If it contains ORG, it sets LC to the number followed by ORG. If it is END pseudo instruc-tion, the assembler terminates the first pass and goes to the second pass: If the line of code has a label, it is stored in the address symbol table together with its binary equivalent number specified by LC. Label LC MIN 100 SUB 107 DIFF 108 Fig. 2 On the first pass, the assembler encounters ORG in the example program (previous problem) and sets the LC to 100. It then scans the next line. If it has neither label nor END, LC is incremented by 1 to 101 & proceeds until HLT, when LC has value of 105. Now LC is incremented by 1 to 106. Upon scanning, it finds label MIN, then SUB and DIFF. The address symbol table is shown in Fig. 2. On encounter-ing the last instruction, END, the assembler goes to sec-ond pass. Second Pass: - Machine instructions are translated during the second pass by means of table-lookup procedures. A table lookup procedure is a search of table entries to determine whether a specific item matches one of the items stored in the table. The assembler uses four tables. 1) Pseudo-instruction table. 2) MRI table. 3) Non-MRI table. 4) Address-symbol table. The way the assembler proceeds in the second pass is described in the flow chart of Fig. 3. LC is initially set to 0. Labels are neglected during the second pass, so the assembler goes immediately to the instruction field. It first checks the pseudo-instruction table. For a match with ORG, the assembler sets LC to num-bers followed by ORG. A match with END terminates the translation process. An operand pseudo instruction causes a conversion of the operand into binary. This operand(e.g. DEC 50 from the previous problem) converted into its binary value is placed in the memory location specified by con-tents of LC i.e. at location 106. The LC is incremented by 1 and the assembler continues to analyze the next line of code. If the symbol encountered is not a pseudo-instruction, the assembler refers to the MRI table. If the symbol is not found in this table, the assembler refers to the non- MRI table e.g. in a scan of the second line, the symbol is CMA with LC = 101. The assembler stores the bit code of CMA into a memory location specified by LC i.e. at place 101. Again LC is incremented by 1 and a new line is analyzed. When a symbol is found in the MRI table, the assembler ex-tracts its equivalent code and inserts it in, say, bits 2-4 of the memory location specified by LC. The correspond-ing second symbol is an address. This is converted to bi-nary by searching the address symbol table. The first bit of instruction is set to 0 or 1, depending on whether the letter I is absent or present. For example the first line from the previous problem is LDA SUB. LDA is an MRI and its equivalent 3 bit code, say, 010 is set in bit position 2-4, SUB is searched in the address symbol table and is found to be at location 107. I is not present, therefore, LDA SUB has the HEX code 2107; its equivalent binary is stored in memory location specified by LC = 100. Therefore memory location 100 contains 2107. One important task of an assembler is to check for possible errors in the symbolic program. This was just the basics of how an assembler performs translation. A practical assembler is much more complicated.", "images": ["images/G09-0214_files/image002.jpg", "images/G09-0214_files/image004.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G09-0214.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "An assembler is a program that accepts a symbolic language and produces its binary machine language equivalent."}

{"question": "What is bile and what is its role in digestion? Where is bile manufactured and how does it reach the food undergoing digestion?", "solution": "Bile is very important for proper digestion, although it contains no enzymes. It is highly alkaline and helps neutralize the acid in the chyme as it leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine. This is necessary in order for the intestinal enzymes to function properly. Bile is composed of bile salts, lecithin, cholesterol and bile pigments. The first three are involved in the emulsification of fat in the small intestine. The bile pigments give bile its color. The major bile pigment is bilirubin. Bilirubin is actually a breakdown product of hemoglobin, the oxygen- carrying protein in red blood cells. In the large intestine, bilirubin and other bile pigments are further converted by bacteria into brown pigments, which give rise to the color of feces. If the bile duct is blocked so that the pigments cannot be excreted in the bile, they will be reabsorbed by the liver. Eventually, the pigments will accumulate in the blood and tissues, giving the skin a yellow color; this condition is called jaundice. Cholesterol is a large fat-like molecule that has a very low solubility in body fluids. This may lead to deposits of cholesterol in the heart and arteries, which could result in heart disease or arteriosclerosis. The liver excretes excess cholesterol in the bile. Gallstones result from the accumulation of excess insoluble cholesterol in the gallbladder. Bile salts are the most active part of bile. They are salts of glycocholic acid, which is made from cholesterol. Unlike cholesterol, bile salts are very soluble. These salts are essential for digestion of fats. Butter and oil are fats which constitute part of a group of molecules called lipids. Lipid molecules are insoluble in water and tend to coalesce to form globules. The enzymes that digest lipids, called lipases, can only work on the surface of these globules. Alone, it would take weeks for lipases to complete fat digestion in this manner. Bile salts solve this problem by having detergent-like properties - they coat the globules and break them up into millions of tiny droplets called micelles. This process, called emulsification, greatly increases the surface area exposed to attack by lipases, speeding up lipid digestion. Bile salts are conserved by the body, and are reabsorbed in the lower part of the intestine, carried back to the liver through the bloodstream, and secreted again. The liver, one of the body's largest organs, constantly secretes bile. (600 - 800 ml. a day) A network of ducts collects the bile and passes it into the gallbladder, where it is stored until needed. The gallbladder is a small muscular sac that lies on the surface of the liver. When food enters the duodenum, certain receptor cells in the wall of the intestine sense the presence of fats in the chyme. Stimulated by the fats, the receptor cells in the duodenum secrete a hormone, called cholecystokinin (CCK) into the bloodstream. This hormone causes inhibiton of gastric motility and contraction of the gallbladder, forcing bile out through the bile duct and into the small intestine.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F17-0436.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Bile is a highly alkaline substance that helps neutralize the acid in the chyme.

That is, medium 1 is \"denser\", and the angle of refraction will be greater than the angle incidence. In general part of the incident ray is reflected and part re-fracted.

Once this is recognized, you can set up equilibrium constant expres-sions which measure theseequilibriain terms of the concentrations of the species involved. There are three simultaneousequilibriain the final solution. Two derive from the acids HCN and HC_2H_3O_2 donating their protons to form hydroniumions in water. The third stems from the ionization of water to hydroniumand hydroxyl ions. You have: (1) HC_2H_3O_2 + H_2O \\rightleftarrows H_3O^+ + C_2H_3O_2^- (2) HCN + H_2O \\rightleftarrows H_3O^+ + CN^- (3) H_2O + H_2O \\rightleftarrows H_3O^+ + OH^-. Each reaction contributes H_3O^+ ions. However, only the acetic acid produces an appreciable concentration of H_3O^+. This can be determined by inspection of the dissociation constants. The larger a dissociation constant, the greater the dissociation of the species. The dissociation constant of acetic acid, 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5, is the largest, and, therefore, its [H_3O^+] contribution is the greatest. As such, you can neglect the H_3O^+ contribution from HCN and water. Let the H_3O^+ contribution from acetic acid = x. If you started with a concentration of .5M for acetic acid, then, at equilibrium, it becomes .5-x. From the dissociation of acetic acid in water, it also becomes evident that the concentration of C_2H_3O_2-can be represented by x, since the equation states H_3O^+ and C_2H_3O_2^- will be produced inequimolarquantities.

{"question": "How does the body control the amount of water excreted?", "solution": "Factors such as blood volume and glomerular capillary pressure act to regulate the amount of fluid initially absorbed by the kidney. The volume of urine excreted, however, is ultimately controlled by the permeability of the walls of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts to water. This permeability can be varied, and is regulated by a hormone known as vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone (ADH). In the absence of ADH, the water permeability of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule is very low, and the final urine volume is corresponding-ly high. In the presence of ADH, water permeability is high, and the final urine volume is small. ADH has no effect on sodium absorption, but regulates the ability of water to osmotically follow ionic absorption ADH is produced by a discrete group of hypothalamic neurons whose axons terminate in the posterior pituitary, from where ADH is released into the blood. The release of ADH is regulated by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus. In-creased plasma osmolarity causes increased secretion of ADH. Decreased osmolarity leads to decreased secretion of ADH. Blood volume also influences ADH secretion via stretch re-ceptors in the left atrium. Increased blood volume stimu-lates this baroreceptor reflex to decrease secretion of ADH. Let us look at the interaction of these regulatory mechanisms in a specific situation. If a man drinks an excess amount of water, but does not increase his sodium intake, the most logical way to maintain optimal osmotic concentrations in the body would be to excrete the excess water without altering normal salt excretion. Intake of the excess water results in an increase in extracellular and blood fluid volumes. This has a two-fold effect: First, the osmotic concentration of the blood decreases. This stimulates the osmoreceptors to cause decreased secretion of ADH. Second, the arterial baroreceptors are stimulated and send impulses to the hypo-thalamus, where ADH release is inhibited. The permeability of the collecting tubules to water is lowered, and conse-quently more water is excreted.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F18-0455.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The body controls the amount of water excreted by regulating the permeability of the walls of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts to water, which is controlled by a hormone known as vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone (ADH)."}
{"question": "Howarethe type of muscle tissues differentiated?", "solution": "The cells of muscle tissue have great capacity for contraction. Muscles are able to perform work by the summed contractions of their individualcells. The individual muscle cells are usually elongate, cylindricalor spindle-shaped cells that are bound together into sheets or bundlesby connective tissue. Three principal types of muscle tissue are found in vertebrates. Skeletal or striated muscle is responsible for most voluntary movements. Smooth muscle is involved in most involuntary movements of internal organs, such as the stomach. Cardiac muscle is the tissue of which much ofthe heart wall is composed; it is also involuntary. Most skeletal muscle, as the name implies, is attached to the bones ofthe body, and its contraction is responsible for the movements of parts ofthe skeleton. Skeletal muscle contraction is also involved in other activitiesof the body, such as the voluntary release of urine and feces. Thus the movements produced by skeletal muscle are primarily involved withinteractions between the body and the external environment. Skeletal muscle reveals a striated appearance, and is therefore alsoreferred to as striated muscle. These striations are actually due to the regulararrangement of thick and thinmyofilamentsin individual muscle fibercells. Skeletal muscle is an exception to the common observation thateach cell contains only one nucleus: each skeletal fiber cell is multinucleated: it has many nuclei. Skeletal muscle can contractcery rapidlybut cannot remain contracted; the fibers must relax before the next contrac-tioncan occur. Smooth muscle can be classified as visceral smooth muscle. It is foundin the walls of hollow visceral or-gans, such as the uterus, urinary bladder, bronchioles and much of the gastrointestinal tract. Vascular smoothmuscle refers to that smooth muscle in the walls of blood vessels. Unlike skeletal muscle cells that are cylindrical, multinucleate, and striated, smooth muscle cells are spin-dle-shaped,uninucleate, and lack striations. This lack of striations accounts for its smooth appearance. They havea slower speed of contraction, but can remain contracted for a longer periodof time than the striated muscle cells. Cardiac muscle has properties similar to those of both skeletal and smoothmuscles. Like skeletal muscle cells, cardiac muscle cells are striated. Like smooth muscle fibers, cardiac muscle fibers are uninucleatedand are designed for endured contraction rather than speedy orstrong contraction.

{"question": "Write a program which counts the number of times each letter is used in input text.", "solution": "1&TRTM = 1 2CHAR = LEN(1) .CH 3LETTERS = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' 4COUNT = TABLE (30) 5READOUTPUT = INPUT:F(DISPLAY) 6TEXT = OUTPUT 7NEXTTEXT CHAR =:F(READ) 8COUNT <CH> = COUNT <CH> + 1:(NEXT) 9DISPLAYOUTPUT = 10LOOPLETTERS CHAR =: F (END) 11OUTPUT = NE(COUNT<CH>) CH 'OCCURS' +COUNT <CH> 'TIMES'(LOOP) 12END The first statement includes a keyword '&TRIM'. Keywords in SNOBGL IV allow access to several parameters and switches internal to the SNOBOL IV system. Keywords begin with ampersand (&) followed by certain identifiers. For example, keyword &TRIM controls the handling of trailing blanks on input of data. If the value of &TRIM is nonzero, trailing blanks are deleted. Other keywords will be explained upon occurrence in the programs. The second statement, CHAR = LEN (1). CH, includes two important features. First, LEN (1), is an example of primitive (Built-in) functions. This function returns a pattern that matches any string of the length specified by the integer in parentheses. INPUT, PUNCH, and OUTPUT are some other primitive functions. The second important feature of the second statement is that it is an example of conditional value assignment (in this case .CH). The conditional value assignment operator (.) is separated from its operands by blanks. In the state-ment CHAR = LEN (1) . CH, variable CHAR is assigned the very first found string of length one, and, in case of success, assigns the same string to CH, which is used as an array subscript later in the program. The fourth statement, COUNT = TABLE (30), introduces the use of tables. Tables of variables can be created by using the primitive function TABLE, for example: T = TABLE ( ) In a very similar way arrays of variables are constructed by using the primitive function ARRAY, for example: A = ARRAY ( ) The arguments of an array, written in parentheses, describe the number of dimensions, the bounds of each dimension, and the initial value of each variable in the array. Thus A = ARRAY (10,1.0) creates and assigns to Aaone-dimensional array of 10 variables, each initialized to the real value 1.0. A table is similar to a one-dimensional array. However, instead of referencing an element with an integer, any data object can be used. In this program, letters of the alphabet are used as subscripts for table elements. The fifth statement of the program introduces the most important feature of the flow of control - a transfer to alabelledstatement. It is specified in the GOTO field which appears at the end of a statement and is separated from the rest of the statement by a colon. Two types of transfers can be specified in the GOTO field: conditional and unconditional, A conditional transfer consists of letters F or S corresponding to failure or success respectively, followed by a label enclosed within parentheses. Thus OUTPUT = INPUT: F(DISPLAY) makes the computerprint outwhatever appears on the data card. If, however, there is no data in the input file, i.e., an end of file is encountered, the transfer is made to the statement labeled display. An unconditional transfer is indicated by the absence of an F or S before the enclosing parentheses. For example, consider state-ment #8 of this program: COUNT<CH> = COUNT<CH> + 1: (NEXT) Each time this statement is executed, the transfer is made to the statementlabelledNEXT. Statement #11 uses one of the primitive functions of a specific group called NUMERICAL PREDICATES. The main ones include: LT - less than... LE - less than or equal to... EQ - equal to... NE - not equal to... GE - greater or equal to... GT - greater than... Statement OUTPUT = NE (COUNT<CH>).... prints out whatever is following the parentheses if the value of COUNT<CH> is not equal to zero. Finally, a statement that is longer than one line can be continued onto successive lines by starting the continuation lines with a period or plus sign. This program employs a plus sign for continua-tion of statement #11. Also note, that the statements in this program are numbered only for easy reference. All labels in SNOBCL IV start with a letter, as was mentioned earlier. If a statement does not start with a label, it must start with at least one blank. The general flow of this program is as follows: statement 1 - deletes trailing blanks; statement 2 - indicates that CHAR and CH will be assigned the first one-character string matched; statement 3 - assigns a string of the 26 letters of the alphabet to variable LETTERS; statement 4 - sets a 30-element table and assigns it to COUNT; statement 5 - prints out the first card of the input text; statement 6 - assigns it to variable TEXT; statement 7 - tests the text for presence of the first one-character string (which is the first letter of the first word in the text), deletes them all one at a time, adding 1 to COUNT<CH> in statement 8 each time around; statement 8 - goes back to statement 7 every time after adding 1 to COUNT<CH>; statement 7 - repeats the loop until all the appearances of each letter are counted, and the table COUNT is set up. Then COUNT fails when no more characters are left; the transfer is made back to statement #5; statement 5 - repeats the whole procedure for every following input card, adding missing members (if there are any) to the table COUNT. Finally it fails when there is no input left and transfers the execution to statement #9; statement 9 - prints a blank line; statement 10 - tests string LETTERS for the presence of a one- character string, finds 26 of them, assigns the first one (i.e., A) to CHAR and deletes it from LETTERS; statement 11 - since CH takes the same value as CHAR, looks in the table for C0UNT<A> which represents the number of times letter A appeared in the text. If finds it, outputs the letter A and the number of its occurrences. In any case it goes back to statement #10; statement 10 - repeats the same procedure for every letter. It fails when no more letters are left and finishes the program.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G15-0387.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The program counts the number of times each letter is used in the input text by setting up a table COUNT, testing the text for presence of the first one-character string, deleting them all one at a time, adding 1 to COUNT<CH> each time around, and repeating the loop until all the appearances of each letter are counted."}
{"question": "Explain the method of copulation in the earthworms.", "solution": "During copulation two worms are united, ventral surface to ventral surface, with the anterior ends in opposite directions and the anterior quarter of the length of the bodies overlapping (see figure in previous question). They are held together in this position in part by mucous secretions from a swollen glandular region called the clitellum. The mucus from the clitellum forms a sleeve around the animals. During copulation, each worm dis-charges sperm that pass from the vas deferens into the seminal receptacles of the other worm, through temporary longitudinal furrows that form in the skin. Following the exchange, the worms separate. A few days after copulation, a cocoon is secreted for the deposition of the eggs and sperm. A mucous tube is secreted around the anterior segments, including the clitellum. The clitellum then secretes a tough chitin-like material that encircles the clitellum like-a cigar band; this material forms the cocoon. When completely formed, the cocoon moves forward over the anterior end of the worm. The eggs are discharged from the female gonopores, and they enter the cocoon before it leaves the clitellum. Sperm are deposited in the cocoon as it passes over the seminal receptacles. As the cocoon slips over the head of the worm, and is freed from the body, the mucous tube quickly disintegrates, and the ends of the cocoon constrict and seal themselves. The cocoons are left in the damp soil, where development takes place. Development is direct, that is, there is no larval stage and the eggs develop into tiny worms within the cocoon.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F12-0298.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "During copulation two worms are united, ventral surface to ventral surface, with the anterior ends in opposite directions and the anterior quarter of the length of the bodies overlapping.

{"question": "You pass a 1.0 amp current through an electrolytic cell for 1.0 hr. There are 96,500 coul in a Faraday (F). Calculate the number of grams of each of the following that would be deposited at the cathode: (1) Ag from an Ag+ solution, (2) Cu from a Cu^+2 solution and (3) A1 from an Al^3+ solution.", "solution": "To answer this problem, you can use Faraday's Laws of Electro-lysis. Electrolysis is the phenomenon that occurs when electricity is passed through a solution, such that ions are generated and move toward an anode or cathode. The laws are as follows: Masses of substances in-volved are proportional to the quantity of electricity that flows through the electrolytic cell. Masses of different substances produced during the process are proportional to their equivalent weight. The electrical equivalent is defined as a Faraday (F). It is capable of reducing one equivalent of positive charge, i.e., Avogadro's number of individual unit electric charges. With this information, you can calculate how many Faraday's of electricity were passed through the solution. This tells you the equivalents of the substance that are reduced (recall, one Faraday reduces one equivalent of positive charge). From this number, the weight deposited can be determined. For all 3 parts, the Faradays generated = (1.00 amp)[1coul / sec.) / (amp)](1hr) times (F / 96,500 coul) = .0373 F. (1) Ag from an Ag^+ solution. 1 electron is transferred in Ag^+ + e^- \\rightarrow Ag(s). Since one electron is transferred per Ag atom, 1 mole of Ag atoms requires one mole of electrons or 1F. 1 mole of Ag atoms weighs 107.87g (atomic weight - see Periodic Table). You have, though, only .0373 F. Thus, (.0373 mole) (107.87g / mole) = 4.02g of Ag is deposited. (2) Here, 2 electrons are transferred in Cu^2+ + 2e^- \\rightarrow Cu(s).

{"question": "Explain how an estimate of the age of a rock is made on the basisof the radioactive elements present.", "solution": "Certain radioactive elements are spon-taneously transformed into otherelements at rates which are slow and essentially unaffected by externalfactors, such as the temperatures and pressures to which the elementsare subjected. The transformation, or decay, of each individual elementtakes place at a rate which can be measured. For example, half ofa given sample of the element uranium will be converted into lead in 4.5 billionyears. Thus, 4.5 billion years is the half-life of uranium. By measuringthe proportion of uranium and lead in a given rock, we can estimatewith a high degree of accuracy the absolute age of the rock. For instance, assume we determine that the ratio of uranium to lead in a given sampleis 1:1. We know, that the rock has existed long enough for half of theoriginal amount of uranium to be converted into lead, or a total of 4.5 billionyears, which is equal to one half-life of uranium. If the ratio is 1:3, three-fourths of the original amount of uranium is now lead, and one-fourth remains. Therefore, two half- lives must have passed, and half of the uraniumremaining after one half-life has turned into lead [(1/2) \u00d7 (1/4)X = (1/4) X, where x equals the original amount of uranium in thesample ]. Two half-lives are equivalent to a time period of 9 (= 2 \u00d7 4.5) billion years, and the age of the rock, then, is 9 billion years. Other methods are used to determine the age of rocks which are notold enough to use the uranium - leadmetodof dating. One of these is thepotassium 40 - argon (K40 -Ar) method. Potassium - 40 decays into argonand has a half-life of 1.3 billion years. Because these two elements arecommonly found in volcanic rock, this method is particularly useful in areaswhere volcanic activity is known to have occurred in the past.

Now x divided by 3 can give a remainder of 0, 1 or 2. The numbers between 1 and 100 can be arranged in three sets S_0 = {3,6,9,...,90,93,96,99} S_1 = {1,4,7,...,94, 97,100} S_2 = {2,5,8,...,92,95,98} Note that {S_0,S_1,S_2} forms a partition of 1 - 100. Similarly, on division by 5, the possible remainders 0,1,2,3,4 give rise to the disjoint sets S_0 = { ,5,10,...,90,95,100} S_1 = {1, 6,11,...,91,96} S_2 = {2,7,12,...,92,97} S_3 = {3,8,13,...93,98} S_4 = {4,9,14,...,94,99} Finally division by 7 yields the following Sets:S_0 = {7,14,...,91,98} S_1 = {1,8,15,...,92,99}S_2 = {2,9,16,...,93,100} S_3 = {3,10,17,...,87,94}S_4 = {4,11,...,88,95} S_5 = {5,12,...,89,96}S_6 = {6,13,...,90,97}. To be concrete, suppose x = 41. Then the remainders are 2,1, 6 when 41 is divided by 3,5 and 7 respectively. Thus, x = 41 lies in S_2 = {2,5,8,...,95,98} S_1 = {1,6,11,...,91,96} and S_6 = {6,13,...,90,97}. In fact, 41 is the only number that simultaneously lies in these three sets ! Now memorizing the above sets is one way of mastering this puzzle but fortunately, a much simpler algorithm exists. It uses the fact that 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 = 105. Let the secret number be x and let A, B, C be the remainders. Then x \\equiv D = 70A + 21B + 15C (mod 105)(1) Thus, for x = 41, 70(2) + 21(1) + 15(6) = 140 + 21 + 90 = 251. But we need x \\leq 100.

{"question": "What would be the simplest and safest reliable method of distinguishing between the following pairs of materials? (a) Water and rubbing alcohol. (b) Gasoline and kerosene, (c) Baking soda and baking powder.", "solution": "(a) Pour to a depth of about one-half inch of each compound into two separate test tubes. Cover each of the test tubes with your thumb and shake them vigorously. There will be an outward pressure on your thumb from the contents of one of the test tubes. This tube contains the rubbing alcohol. This pressure is called vapor pressure. It is proportional to the ability of a liquid to vaporize or evaporate. Vapor pressure is a measure of the physical property called volatility. Rubbing alcohol is more volatile than water and will have a greater vapor pressure and lower boiling point. (b) Gasoline and kerosene are both products of the distillation of crude oil. Distillation is a process used to separate mixtures of liquids. When a liquid is distilled it is boiled in a round bottomed container at the end of a glass enclosed tube. The various compounds in the mixture burn at their own distinctive boiling points. Thus, first the lowest boiling substance will boil and evaporate, then as the mixture becomes hotter the next lowest and so on until no compounds are left in the container. As each com-pound boils its vapors enter the tube or column where they are condensed and eventually collected. A different vessel is used to collect each fraction with a distinct boiling point and hence the mixture becomes separated into its various components. The more times a fraction is distilled the more pure a sample made. This is the best method for separating gasoline and kerosene. Gasoline burns over a range from 40\\textdegree to 200\\textdegreeC and kerosene from 175\\textdegree to 275\\textdegreeC. They can be easily separated by distillation. The accompany-ing figure shows a fractional distillation of crude oil. (c) The difference between baking soda and baking powder is that baking soda is a compound and baking powder is a mixture. A compound is a homogeneous substance composed of two or more elements, the proportions of which are fixed and invariable by weight. A mixture is a substance made of two or more elements or compounds in a nonhomogeneous combination. Under a magnifying glass or microscope one will not be able to distinguish the components of a compound whereas one can readily identify the components of a mix-ture.

The dissociation of phosgene may be written as COCI_2 (g) \\rightleftarrows CO (g) + Cl_2 (g) . By definition,K_pis the product of the partial pressures of the products divided by the product of the partial pressure of the reactants. Hence, K = { P_CO P(Cl)2} / {P(COCl)2} = {(0.116atm) (0.128atm)} / {.334atm} = 0.0444 atm. K_pfor the dissociation of phosgene is thus 0.0444 atm. Let \\alpha denote the fraction of the original number of moles of phosgene that decomposed. Then, 1 - \\alpha is the fraction of the original number of moles of phosgene re-maining. From thestoichiometryof the dissociation re-action, one mole of CO and one mole of Cl_2 are formed for every mole of phosgene that decomposes. Thus, \\alpha moles of phosgene decomposes to \\alpha moles of CO and \\alpha moles of CI_2.

Since the total number of moles present after \\alpha moles of phosgene decomposes is (1 - \\alpha)(from remaining phosgene) + \\alpha (from CO) + \\alpha (from Cl_2 ) = 1 + \\alpha we have P(COCl)2= X(COCl)2P_T= [(1 -\\alpha) / (1 + \\alpha)] P_T P_CO = X_CO P_T= [\\alpha / (1 + \\alpha)] P_T and P(Cl)2= X(Cl)2P_T = [\\alpha / (1 + \\alpha)] P_T Substituting these into the expression forK_p, we obtain K_p= {P_CO P(Cl)2} / {P(COCl)2} = {([\\alpha / (1 + \\alpha)] P_T ) ( [\\alpha / (1 + \\alpha)] P_T )} / ( [ (1 -\\alpha) / (1 + \\alpha) ] P_T ) = {\\alpha^2 / [(1 + \\alpha) / (1 - \\alpha) ]} P_T = { \\alpha^2 / (1 -\\alpha^2 ) } P_T , Now, the total pressure is P_T = 1atmandK_phas been determined as K_p= 0.0444 atm.

{"question": "Why do some viruses contain only one type of protein in their protective coat?", "solution": "The nucleic acid in a virus particle is surrounded by a protein coat, called a capsid, made up of protein subunits called capsomeres. A complete virus particle is called a virion and it may be covered by an envelope. Those that do not have envelopes are termed naked virions, while those virions that do have envelopes are termed enveloped. A typical naked and an enveloped virion are shown in Fig.1. Some of the protein coats are complex, containing numerous layers and various different proteins. Some also include lipid and carbohydrate molecules. Others, however, contain only one or a few types of protein molecules in their coats. The use of a large number of identical proteins in the protective coat of viruses is often mandatory. The extremely small viruses have a limited nucleic acid content which restricts the total number of amino acidsthat can be used to synthesize its protein. For example, there are approximately 6000 nucleotides in a TMV RNA chain. The TMV RNA can therefore code for a protein 2000 amino acids in length. (Three nucleotides are needed to code for one amino acid.) Since each amino acid weighs about 125 daltons (a dalton is a unit of weight equal to the weight of a single hydrogen atom), this protein molecule of 2000 amino acids should weigh 2.5 \u00d7 10^5 daltons. However, since we know the protein coat of TMV weighs 3.5 \u00d7 10^7 dal- tons, about 140 (3.5 \u00d7 10^7 \\div 2.5 \u00d7 10^5) of these protein molecules would be needed. The virus does not use all its nucleic acids to code for a single protein. Since only a very small part of the RNA chain codes for the coat protein, the proteins consist of fewer amino acids. Therefore, many smaller identical protein molecules are used to construct the protein coat. Since the number of identical protein molecules used to form the TMV protein coat is about 2150, each protein molecule consists of about 128 amino acids {[(3.5 \u00d7 10^7 daltons) / (2150 proteins)] \u00d7 [(1 amino acid) / (125 daltons)] = (128 amino acids) / (proteins )} The protein subunits either possess helical symmetry or cubical (or quasi-cubical) symmetry. The TMV shell con-sists of identical protein molecules helically arranged around a central RNA molecule (see Fig. 2) . The Adenovirus is an icosahedral virion, exhibiting quasi-cubical sym-metry (see Fig. 3).

{"question": "Explain how the sense organ of equilibrium functions in the crayfish.", "solution": "The sense organ of equilibrium in the crayfish is the antenna. All crustaceans have two pairs of antennae. The second pair in lobsters and crayfish is extremely long; this pair functions in touch and taste. At each base of the first pair, astatocystis present, which functions in the maintenance of equilibrium. Thestatocystsare sacs that open to the exterior. Inside the sac is astatolith, com-posed of fine sand grains cemented together by secretions from thestatocystwall. Along the floor of the sac are a number of rows of sensory hairs. These hairs arise from sensory receptor cells and are innervated by theantennularnerve. When the crayfish is in an upright po-sition, continual impulses from both right and leftstatocystscounterbalance each other and the crayfish does not lean to either side. If the animal is rotated onto its right side, thestatolith of the left side exerts a gravi-tational pull on the sensory hairs, which send impulses to the brain. Thestatolithon the right side does not exert a pull on the sensory hairs, and the crayfish as a result rotates to the left, thus balancing itself. If the animal is turned so that bothstatolithsare exerting forces, and impulses are sent from bothstatocysts, the crayfish rotates in the direction of whicheverstatocystis most stimulated. Thestatocystis aninvaginationof the ectoderm, which forms the exoskeleton, and is shed with each molt. The animal must gather new sand grains to form thestatolith. This is done by inserting sand into the statocyst sac or by burying the head in sand. Studies of thestatocyst's function were done by inserting' iron filings into sand when crayfish molted, and using a magnet to directstatolithforces on the sensory hairs. Thestatocystmay also function to maintain position during movement. For this purpose there are free sensory hairs, which are not in contact with thestatolith.

{"question": "List and compare the tissues that support and hold together theother tissues of the body.", "solution": "Connective tissue functions to support and hold together structures ofthe body. They are classified into four groups by structure and/or function: bone, car-tilage, blood, and fibrous connective tissue. The cells of thesetissues characteristicallyscretea large amount ofnoncellular material, called matrix. The nature and func-tion of each kind of connective tissueis determined largely by the nature of its matrix. Connective tissue cellsare actually quiteseperatefrom each other, for most of the connectivetissue volume is made up of matrix. The cells between them functionindirectly, by secreting a matrix which performs the actual functionsof connection or support or both. Blood consists of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in aliquid matrix called the plasma. Blood has its major function in transportingalmost any substance that is needed, anywhere in the body. The fibrous connective tissues have a thick matrix composed of interlacingprotein fibers secreted by and sur-rounding the connective tissuecells. These fibers are of three types:collagenousfibers, which are flexiblebut resist stretching and give considerable strength to the tissues containingthem; elastic fibers which can easily be stretched, but return to theirnormal length like a rubber band when released, and reticular fibers whichbranch and interlace to form complex networks. These fibrous tissuesoccur throughout the body, and hold skin to the muscle, keep glandsin position, and bind together many other structures. Tendons and ligamentsare specialized types of fibrous connective tissue. Tendons are notelastic but are flexible, cable-like cords that connect muscles to each otheror to bones. Ligaments are semi-elastic and connect bones to bones. The supporting skeleton of vertebrates is composed of the connectivetissues cartilage and bone. Cartilage cells secrete a hard rubberymatrix around themselves. Cartilage can support great weight, yet itis flexible and somewhat elastic. Cartilage is found in the human body at thetip of the nose, in the ear flaps, the larynx and trachea,intervertebral discs, surfaces of skeletal joints and ends of ribs, to name a few places. Bone has a hard, relatively rigid matrix. This matrix contains many collagenousfibers and water, both of which prevent the bone from being overlybrittle.

{"question": "A mixture of gaseous oxygen and nitrogen is stored at atmospheric pressure in a 3.7 l iron container maintained at constant temperature. After all the oxygen has re-acted with the iron walls of the container to form solid iron oxide of negligible volume, the pressure is measured at 450 torr. Determine the final volume of nitrogen and the initial and final partial pressures of nitrogen and oxygen.", "solution": "The partial pressure of each component, which is independent of any other component in a gaseous mixture, at a defined volume, is equal to the pressure each com-ponent would exert if it were the only gas in that volume. The total pressure of a gaseous mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the components. These two definitions are sufficient to solve this problem. Once all the oxygen has reacted, no oxygen is present in the gaseous phase, so that the final partial pressure of oxygen is zero. By the second definition, final total pressure = final partial pressure of N_2 + final partial pressure of O_2 450 torr = final partial pressure of N_2 + O torr or,final partial pressure of N_2 = 450 torr. But since, after all the oxygen has reacted, only nitrogen fills the entire volume, the final volume of nitrogen is 3.7 l, By the first definition, the initial partial pressure of nitrogen is the same as the final partial pressure of nitrogen, 450 torr. We now again employ the second definition to determine the last re-maining unknown quantity, the initial partial pressure of oxygen. Proceeding, we obtain initial total pressure = initial partial pressure of O_2 + initial partial pressure of N_2 1 atm = initial partial pressure of O_2 + 450 torr or,initial partial pressure of O_2 = 1 atm - 450 torr = 760 torr - 450 torr = 310 torr.

{"question": "Two springs are joined and connected to a mass m which rides on a frictionless surface (see figure (a)). What is the frequency v of the oscillation that will result if the mass is displaced a small distance x?", "solution": "We must show that the configuration of figure (a), is equivalent to that of mass m, connected to a single spring having force constant k'. In figure (b), a mass m is shown connected to such a spring. A segment of the spring is divided into two sections of length x_1 and x_2. The tension in these two sections must be equal, as must be true of the tension in any other arbitrary sections into which the spring may be divided. If this were not the case, the spring would buckle. In general, when the spring is stretched or compressed by a force F, the changes in length \u2206x_1 and \u2206x_2 of sections x_1 and x_2 will not be equal since the magnitudes of such distortions will be proportional to the lengths of the segments involved. We can see this by symmetry. If a spring is stretched to twice its usual length, for example, each arbitrary section must stretch to twice its usual length. If we choose the sections to be of unequal length, the amount that each section stretches will be different. Thus: F = -k_1 \u2206x_1 = -k_2 \u2206x_2 since we know that the force that the spring exerts on the mass equals the tension within each section. The force constants of sections x_1 and x_2 are represent-ed by k_1 and k_2. It is not unreasonable to assume that each arbitrary section of the spring can be considered to have a dif-ferent force constant as long as: F= -k_1 \u2206x_1 = -k_2 \u2206x_2 = -k_3 \u2206x_3 = . . . -k_n \u2206x_n = -k'x where x = \u2206x_1 + \u2206x_2 + \u2206x_3 + . . . + \u2206x_n is the total displacement of the mass. Thus we see that in the case of the two connected springs above, the tension in each must be equal: F = -k_1 \u2206x_1 = -k_2 \u2206x_2 = -k'x = -k'(\u2206x_1 + \u2206x_2) \u2206x_1 = -(F/k_1) \u2206x_2 =-(F/k_2) Thus: k' = -[F/(\u2206x_1 + \u2206x_2)] = -[F/{-(F/k_1) - (F/k_1)}] = [1/{(1/k_1) + (1/k_2)}] = 1/[(k_1 +k_2)/(k_1k_2)] = (k_1k_2)/(k_1 +k_2) Since the frequency of an oscillator having force constant k' is: v = [1/(2\\pi)]\\surd(k'/m) then:v = [1/(2\\pi)]\\surd[(k_1k_2)/{(k_1 + k_2)m}]", "images": ["images/D09-0375_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Physics/D09-0375.htm", "image_question": true, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "v = [1/(2\\pi)]\\surd[(k_1k_2)/{(k_1 + k_2)m}]"}

Hence two wires exert upward forces on the bar of magni-tude F_n, and one wire exerts a force of magnitude F'_n = [AY(\u22061 - 0.05 cm)]/[1_0 + 0.05 cm] Since the ratio 0.05/1_0 = .00025 is so small, we may ignore 0.05 in comparison with 1_0 in the denominator of the expression for F'_n. Then because thebar is in equilibrium, we obtain bar is in equilibrium, we obtain W = 2F_n + F'_n = (AY/1_0)(2\u22061 + \u22061 - 0.05 cm). Therefore \u22061 = (1/3)[(1_0w)/AY) + 0.05 cm] However A = \\piR^2 = \\piD^2/4, where R and D are the radius and diameter, respectively, of the wire. We are given D = 1 mm = 1 mm \u00d7 (1cm/10 mm) = 0.1 cm. Hence \u22061 = (1/3)[{(200 cm \u00d7 12 kg \u00d7 981 \u00d7 10^3 dynes)/(\\pi/4 \u00d7 10^-2 cm^2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 10^12 dynes \\textbullet cm^-2)} + 0.05 cm] = (1/3)(0.15 + 0.05)cm = 0.0667 cm = 0.667 mm. Thus two of the wires are stretched by 0.667 mm and the other by (0.667 - 0.05)mm = 0.167mm. Also F_n/F'_n = [\u22061/(\u22061 - 0.05 cm)] = (0.667 mm)/(0.167 mm) = 4; 12 kg = W = 2F_n + F'_n = 9F'_n. \\thereforeF'_n = 1(1/3) kgandF_n = 5(1/3) kg. \\thereforeF'_n = 1(1/3) kgandF_n = 5(1/3) kg.", "images": ["images/D08-0349_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Physics/D08-0349.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Two of the wires are stretched by 0.667 mm and the other by 0.167mm.

{"question": "How can radioactive isotopes be used in biological research such as tracing the pathways of compounds synthesized in the living cell?", "solution": "Labeling substance with radioactive isotopes is a powerful method for studying specific metabolic pathways, as well as being applicable to many other areas of biological research. Radioactive labeling has been used, for example, in determining the rates of metabolic processes in intact organisms, and also in determining whether a given metabolic pathway is the predominant route, for a given metabolite. It is used in establishing whether a pathway which has been studied in a test tube is the same reaction that occurs in vivo. Labeling is done by taking the compound in question and substituting in a radioactive isotope for one of the naturallyoccuringelements comprising the compound.(see Table). The radioactive isotope, when incorporated into a biological system will undergo spontaneousemmisionof radiation while taking part in the same biological acti-vities as its non-radioactive counterpart. Although this is not observable by eye, there are many known methods by which these emissions can be detected. The methods commonly employed include Geiger counters, photographic methods, fluorescent methods, and cloud chambers. In this way, the course of the reaction can be followed. The value of radioactive tracers in biological research can be seen by considering the photosynthetic equation: 6 CO_2 + 6 H_2O(sunlight/chlorophyll)\\rightarrowC_6H_12O_6 + 6 O_2. Although in the equation the photosynthetic process appears to be a simple reaction, it actually follows a very complicated course. This complex reaction, like most others, proceeds through a series of changes involving one or two molecules at a time.

To solve: (1) determine the weight of the bottles and the number of moles of soda-lime glass that this weight is equivalent to.

{"question": "If antibodies can be brought into contact with a virus before it attaches itself to the host cell, the virus will be inactivated. Once infection has occurred, the production of interferon may protect the host from ex-tensive tissue destruction. Explain.", "solution": "Many human diseases have a viral etiology (cause). Among the more common viral diseases are smallpox, chicken pox, mumps, measles, yellow fever, influenza, rabies, poliomyelitis, viral pneumonia, fever blisters (coldsores), and the common cold. Although most viral infections do not respond to treatment with many of the drugs effective against bacterial infection , many are preventable by means of vaccines. Buildup of an adequate supply of antibodies requires some time. During this period, extensive viral infection may occur. Most recoveries from viral diseases occur before full development of the immune response (productionof antibodies). A factor that is important in the recovery from a viral infection is interferon. Interferon is a protein produced by virus- infected cells, which spreads to uninfected cells and makes them more resistant to viral infection. Thus, extensive viral production and resultant tissue damage are prevented. Upon infection, the host cell is induced to syn-thesize interferon, a small protein which is then released into the extracellular fluid and affects the surrounding cells. Interferon binds to surface receptors of uninfected cells . This triggers these cells to synthesize acyto-plasmicenzyme which prevents viral multiplication. Note that the antiviral protein does notprevent entrance of the viral nucleic acid. Interferon produced by a cell infected with a particular virus can prevent healthy cells from becoming infected by almost all other types of viruses . Inter-feron is therefore not virus-specific. However, inter-feron produced by one host species is not effective if ad-ministered to a different species . It is therefore host species specific. Since interferon produced by birds and other mammals cannot be used in treating human beings, it is difficult to obtain large enough quantities of inter-feron to provide effective chemotherapy for viral diseases. (Human donors cannot provide the needed amount of inter-feron.) Interferon is a more rapid response to viral infection than antibody response . Interferon production is initiated within hours after viral infection, reaching a maximum after two days. Within three or four days, interferon production declines as antibodies are produced. Prevention of viral infection by interferon production must be distinguished from another phenomenon - viral interference. Viral interference is observed when an initial viral infection prevents a secondary infection of the same cell by a different virus. The initial virus somehow prevents reproduction of the second virus or inactivates re- ceptors on the cell membrane (there are specific sites for viral attachment ). It may also stimulate production of an inhibitor of the second virus . Viral interference does not prevent uninfected cells from becoming infected .

In the inertial frame of reference, the velocity of the fuel is v - u which is the velocity of the rocket minus the velocity of the fuel with respect to the rocket. The mass of the fuel ejected during time \u2206t is \u2206m, and so its momentum is \u2206m(v - u).

{"question": "In contrast to density dependent effects, there are also density independent effects which operate without reference to population size. Elaborate on the major density independent effects and their relationship to population size.", "solution": "There is no scientific principle which states that populations must be controlled as a function of density. Density effects will always be working in crowded populations, but it is also possible for actual control of population size to be exercised before crowding occurs. Control agents that are not dependent on density can take the form of sudden events that are catastrophic to animal populations. Catastrophic events can solve the problem of overcrowding just as efficiently as a density dependent device. Hurricanes and volcanic explosions can destroy entire populations but these events are too scattered and local to be used as examples for general population controls. More applicable are the common catastrophes which we know as changes in the weather. Nearly all places on the earth suffer seasonal changes from summer to winter, from warm to cold, and from wet to dry. Each of these cyclic changes represents hazards to the animals of each area. Thus, growing populations are frequently cut back, making their normal lives a race to reproduce so quickly that there shall be at least some survivors following the next catastrophe. Unless something happens to prevent the catastrophe from occurring such a popu-lation may never grow large enough to suffer the effects of crowding. Density independent factors may play an important role in limiting some organisms, particularly those with very short life cycles characterized by a growth curve in which the environmental limiting factors do not become effective until after many generations (see fig. 1). A sudden strong density independent limitation then brings growth to an end before density dependent factors can become operative. The density independent effects are definite factors in moving population growth upward or downward, but they cannot hold the population size at a constant level. As a result, populations effected by density independent factors are under control but their numbers fluctuate within wide limits (see fig. 2) and can hardly be described as \"in balance.\"", "images": ["images/F30-0770_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F30-0770.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Density independent effects can take the form of sudden events that are catastrophic to animal populations, such as hurricanes, volcanic explosions, and changes in the weather.

{"question": "A vertical spring has an unstretched length L. When a mass m hangs at rest from its lower end, its length increases to L + l. Find the period of small vertical oscillations of m (figure).", "solution": "When the mass is hanging at rest (figure b), the extension of the spring is l and the force exerted by it on m is, according to Hooke's law, S = -kl. The positive direction is downward, but S is an upward force and therefore negative. Since the mass has no acceleration, this upward force exerted by the spring must be exactly counterbalanced by the weight, mg and by Newton's Second Law, F_net = -kl + mg = 0. Hence, mg = kl .(1) Suppose that, during the oscillation, the mass is a distance x below its equilibrium position, so that the ex-tension of the spring is l + x (figure c). The force exert-ed on m by the spring is then S' = -k(l + x) = -kl -kx. The total force F on m is the sum of S' and the weight mg. F = S' + mg F = -kl -kx + mg. According to equation (1) -kl cancels +mg, so F = -kx(2) where x is the extension of the spring from its equilibrium position (figure c). In order to find the period of small vertical oscillations of m, we must solve the equation of motion (2) for x(t). Noting that F = ma = m[(d^2x)/(dt)^2] we may write, from (2) m[(d^2x)/(dt)^2] = -kx [(d^2x)/(dt)^2] + (k/m)x = 0(3) We define \\omega^2 _0 = k/m.(4) using (3) and (4), [(d^2x)/(dt)^2] + \\omega2_0x = 0(5) This is a linear, second order differential equation for x in terms of the variable t. A valid method of solu-tion is to make an educated guess for x (t), substitute this guess into (5), and see if an identity results. If so, x(t) is the solution of (5). A good guess for x(t) is x(t) = A cos(at + \\Phi).(6) where a, A and \\Phi are arbitrary constants. Noting that [dx(t)]/dt = -aA sin(at + \\Phi) [d^2x(t)]/dt^2 = -a^2A cos(at + \\Phi) and substituting these results into (5), we obtain -a^2A cos(at + \\Phi) + \\omega2_0 A cos(at + \\Phi) = 0 which is an identity if \\omega2_0 = a^2. Hence, x(t) is a solution if \\omega_0 = a and x(t) = A cos(\\omega_0t + \\Phi).

The concentration of body fluids in marine fish is about one-third that of the sea water. Osmotic pressure, being higher in sea water, tends to drive water out of the body fluid of the fish.One site of severe water loss is the gill, which is exposed directly to the surrounding water for gaseous diffusion. To compensate for this loss, the fish must take in large amounts of water. How-ever, the only source of water available is sea water; if consumed, the sea water would cause further water loss from the body cells because of its higher osmotic pressure. Marine fish, however, overcome this problem. In the gills, excess salt from the consumed sea water is actively transported out of the blood and passed back into the sea. Marine birds and reptiles also face the same problem of losing water. Sea gulls and penguins take in much sea water along with the fish which they scoop from the sea. To remove the excess salt, there are glands in the bird's head which can secrete saltwater having double the osmolarityof sea water. Ducts from these glands lead into the nasal cavity and the saltwater drips out from the tip of the bill. The giant sea turtles, a marine reptile, has similar glands but the ducts open near the eyes.

{"question": "The ameba has no mouth for ingestion of food, but can take food in at any part of the cell. Explain this method of ingestion. What occurs following ingestion?", "solution": "In the amoeba, pseudopodia (false feet) are used for nutrient procurement. These are temporary projections of cytoplasm which extend around the prey in a cup-like fashion eventually enveloping it completely. These pseudopodia can form anywhere on the surface of the amoeba. The enclosing of the captured organism by cyto-plasm results in the formation of a food vacuole within the amoeba. Usually, the pseudopodia are not in intimate contact with the prey during engulfment and a considerable amount of water is enclosed within the food vacuole along with the captured organism. Engulfment may also involve complete contact with the surface of the prey, and the resulting vacuole is then completely filled by food. Death of the prey takes from 3 to 60 minutes and results primari-ly from a lack of oxygen. Digestion occurs within the food vacuole. In amoeba, as in man, digestion is controlled by enzymes, and dif-ferent enzymes act at definite hydrogen-ion concentrations. The enzymes that function in the vacuoles of an amoeba enter by fusion of the vacuoles withlysosomes. The enzymes hydrolyze the proteins into amino acids, fats into fatty acids and glycerol, and carbohydrates into simple sugars.

{"question": "What is meant by the term \"social\" and \"solitary\" as applied to insects?", "solution": "\"Solitary\" insects are those capable of many functions including sexual reproduction, food gathering and other types of non-reproductive behavior. \"Social\" insects are insects living in aggregations in which there is extensive division of labor and internal societal organization. Colonial organization in insect societies is similar to that in a coelenterate colony, except that the insects are not anatomically joined, as are the members of anObeliacolony. The individual insects of a society are incapable of independent survival, and both their structure and function are specialized for their particular role in the society. Division of labor in insect societies is based upon major biological dif-ferences between individuals. Exactly how different castes are determined is not fully understood, and the process is not the same in different insect species. Ants, termites, certain wasp and bee species are social insects. Insect behavior is based primarily on instinct, and is subject to relatively little modification, or learning. The individual has no choice of role in this system. Insect societies are not analogous to human societies. Most adult humans are capable of reproduction. Insect societies set apart several individuals for a solely re-productive role, while the other individuals are sterile and function in maintaining the colony. Human behavior is based-primarily on learning, and division of labor is not chiefly based on biological differences.

{"question": "A radio telescope sited on the edge of a cliff over-looking the sea operates on a wavelength of 100 m. A radio star rises above the horizon and is tracked by the telescope. The first minimum of the received signal occurs when the star is 30\\textdegree above the horizontal. Explain why the minimum occurs and determine the height of the cliff, assuming that radio wave suffer a phase change of \\pi on reflection at a water surface. (See figure.)", "solution": "The radio telescope is receiving signals direct from the star (ray XBC) and also by reflection from the water surface, (YAC) which is acting like a plane mirror. In this case the source of radiation is far enough away to be considered at infinity and the rays are descending on the earth in a parallel beam. When the path difference between rays YAC and XBC (see figure) is such that they reach the telescope exactly out of phase, destructive interference occurs and the signal at C will be a minimum. Consider the diagram. If AB is drawn perpendicular to XC, it will also be perpendicular to YA, and AB is a plane wave front of the incoming beam. Thus the disturbances at A and B have the same phase at all times. A phase change of it occurs at A and this is equivalent to an increase in path of \\lambda/2. Thus the path difference between the two rays is \\delta = AC + (\\lambda/2) - BC. But by the laws of reflection \\angleYAZ = \\angleCAO = 30\\textdegree, and therefore \\angleBAC = 180\\textdegree - 90\\textdegree - 30\\textdegree - 30\\textdegree = 30\\textdegree. \\delta = AC + \\lambda/2 - AC sin 30\\textdegree = \\lambda/2+ AC(1 - sin 30\\textdegree) Since sin 30\\textdegree = Y/AC, AC = Y/sin 30\\textdegree and \\delta = \\lambda/2 + [y/(sin 30\\textdegree)] (1- sin 30\\textdegree) = \\lambda/2 + y.

The variation that exists between pressure and tem-perature at different states can be expressed as (P_1 / T_1 ) T_1 ) = (P_2 /T_2 ) = (P_2 /T_2 ) where P_1 = pressure of original state, T_1 = absolute tem-perature of original state , P_2 = pressure of final state, and T_2 = absolute temperature of final state .

{"question": "What are the advantages of a segmented body plan? Which animal phyla have segmentation?", "solution": "Segmentation offers the advantage of allowing specialization of different body segments for different functions. More primitive animals have a large number of segments, all very similar to one another. More complex animals have fewer segments, and the specialization of different segments may be so far advanced that the original segmentation of the body plan is obscured. \\textasciigraveAnnelida, the phylum containing earthworms, marine worms, and leeches, is the most primitive invertebrate group displaying segmentation. Earthworms and most marine worms, have both internal and external segmentation. The earthworm body is composed of one hundred or more segments. The segments are separated by partitions termed septa. The marine worms often have incomplete septa, and the leeches have lost the septa completely. Except for a few specialized head and tail segments, the appendages and musculature of all segments are exactly the same. Internally, each segment has a pair of excretory organs and its own ventral nerve ganglion. The earthworm has five pairs of muscular tube-like hearts, two pairs of testes, three pairs of seminal vesicles, and one to five pairs of seminal receptacles. Molluscsexhibit embryonic development very similar to that of annelids, and the larval form, called thetrochophore, is very similar in both phyla. This similar-ity suggests a possible evolutionary relationship betweenmolluscsand annelids.Neopilinais the only living species of molluscs showing segmentation; it may, however, only be secondary. Onycophora (Peripatusand relatives) is a very small phylum showing segmentation. Theonycophoranshave a com-bination of annelid and arthropod characteristics, and provide an evolutionary link between these two phyla. Theonycophoranshave many similar segments with 14 to 43 pairs of short,unjointedlegs. Arthropods are a large group of segmented animals that have evolved in many complex ways. More primitive forms have paired, similar appendages oneaahsegment. More advanced forms have appendages modified for a variety of functions such as sensory antennae, feeding apparatus, walking legs, swimming legs, claws, reproductive apparatus, and respiratory structures, depending upon the species. The more advanced arthropods have a greatly reduced number of segments. These arthropods also have a fusion of body segments into distinct regions, such as a head and trunk, or head, thorax and abdomen. Internally, there is a great deal of specialization, and septa between segments have been lost. The first six segments always form a head, usually with a well-developed brain and sense organs. In primitive forms there are ganglia in every segment, but in many groups the ganglia have fused to formganglionic masses. Aquatic arthropods may have one pair or several pairs of excretory organs, orcoxalglands. In most groups of terrestrial arthropods, the excretory organs areMalpighiantubules. Generally, there is only one pair of reproductive organs; centipedes, however may have 24 testes. Chordata is the other phylum characterized by segmen-tation. As with the arthropods, there also has been in-creasing specialization of segments in chordates. In man, the nervous system and the skeletal system aresegmentallyorganized.

Millikan. Oil droplets are sprayed between a top plate having a positive charge and a bottom plate having a negative charge. A beam of X-rays is simultaneously di-rected at this spray. The X-rays will knock electrons out of molecules in the air and these electrons will be picked up by the oil droplets, which will acquire a charge that is an integral multiple of the electronic charge. This occurs because each oil droplet will pick up an integral number of electrons. By adjusting the charge on the plates, the upward pull on the electrons due to attraction by the positive plate on the top and repulsion by the negative plate on the bottom can be balanced against the downward pull of gravity. The forces are balanced when the oil drop is stationary, as viewed through a telescope. By equating the gravitational and the electrostatic forces one can determine the charge on an oil droplet. It is given that the following charges were observed on oil droplets: 1.44 \u00d7 10^-18, 2.56 \u00d7 10^-18, 4.80 \u00d7 10^-19, and 9.60 \u00d7 10^-19 coulomb.

Alternatively, it is a pressure antinode. Similarly, the open end of the tube is a displacement maximum, or a pressure node. Now, suppose the fork starts at point c and sends a compression wave down the tube. When this wave reaches the bottom of the tube, it must be reflected as a compression if that end is to remain a pressure anti-node. The reflected compression travels back up the tube. If resonance is to occur, the compression must reach the tine of the tuning fork when the latter is ready to move from b to c. (In this situation, the tine is preparing to send a rarefaction down the tube). If this does not occur, the top of the tube will not remain a pressure node, for the reflected pressure wave and the new pressure wave will not cancel. Hence, in 1/2 oscillation of the tuning fork, the wave travels a distance 2L (twice the tube length). In general, resonance will occur if the wave travels a distance 2L in an odd number of half oscillations of the fork. If the wave velocity is v and the frequency of the fork is v_source, the resonance condition is 2L = v(n + 1/2)/ v_source(n = 0, 1, 2 ...)(1) Since the wave frequency equals the source frequency, we may write v_wave = v_source= v Butv_wave \\lambda = v where \\lambda is the wavelength of the wave. Hence, (1) becomes 2L = v(n + 1/2)/v Solving this for v v = (2Lv)/(n + 1/2)(n = 0, 1, 2 ...)(2) Therefore, we may measure v if we know the tube length, the source frequency, and the value of n. In practice, the tube is put in the water, and slowly drawn out as the fork vibrates. When the first reso-nance occurs, n = 0, and the length of tube extending out of the water is measured. Again, the tube is drawn out of the water. When the second resonance occurs, n = 1, and the tube length is again measured, etc. Each resonance will give us the same value for v, as equation (2) indicates. Using the relation v = v\\lambda where \\lambda is the wavelength of the wave, we may also write (2) as v = [2L/(n + 1/2)] (v/\\lambda) orL = (n + 1/2) (v/\\lambda)(n = 0, 1, 2, ...)(3) In practice, an antinode never occurs quite at the end of an open pipe. Its position is just beyond the end of the pipe, the maximum displacement slightly overshooting the end (see figs. (a) and (b)). Thus for the first reso-nance (n = 0 in (3)) the length of the tube will be almost a quarter of a wavelength, and \\lambda/4 = L + E, where L is the length of the air column and E is the end correction. Similarly, for the second resonance, 3\\lambda/4 = L' + E, where L' is the length of the air column when the second resonance occurs. Thus, using our data, \\lambda/2 = L' - L = (66.4 - 21.9) cm = 44.5 cmor\\lambda = 89 cm. Therefore the velocity of sound is v = f\\lambda = 384 s^-1 \u00d7 89 cm = 34176 cm \\bullet s^-1 = 341.8 m \\bullet s^-1. Further, E = \\lambda/4 - L = (22.25 - 21.9) cm = 0.35 cm. The velocity of sound in a gas is proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature. Hence v_0/v = \\surd[T_0/T] = \\surd(2730K / 286\\textdegreeK) = 0.977. \\thereforev_0 = 0.977 \u00d7 341.8 m \\bullet s^-1 = 333.9 m \\bullet s^-1.", "images": ["images/D26-0837_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Physics/D26-0837.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "341.8 m/s and 0.35 cm"}
{"question": "Can complete equilibrium in a gene pool exist in real situations?", "solution": "Of the four conditions necessary for the genetic equilibrium described by the Hardy-Weinberg Law, the first, large population size is met reasonably often; the second, absence of mutations, is never met; the third, no migration, is met sometimes; and the fourth, random reproduction, is rarely met in real situations. Therefore it follows that complete equilibrium in a gene pool is not expected. With regard to the first condition, many natural populations are large enough so that chance alone is not likely to cause any appreciable alteration in gene frequen-cies in their gene pools. Any breeding population with more than 10,000 members of breeding age is probably not significantly affected by random changes. The second condition for genetic equilibrium the absence of mutations, is never met in any population be-cause spontaneous mutations are always occurring. Most genes probably undergo mutation once in every 50,000 to 1,000,000 duplications, with the rate of mutation for different genes varying greatly. However, since the rate of spontaneous mutation is usually low, it is usually insignificant in altering the gene frequencies in a large population. The third condition for genetic equilibrium, implies that a gene pool cannot exchange its genes with the out-side. Immigration or emigration of individuals would change the gene frequencies in the gene pool. A high percentage of natural populations, however, experience some amount of migration. This factor, which enhances variation, tends to upset. Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. The fourth condition, random reproduction, refers not only to the indiscriminate selection of a mate but also to a host of other requirements that contribute to success in propagating the viable offspring. Such factors include the fertility of the mating pair, and the survival of the young to reproductive age. An organism's genotype actually influences its selection of a mate, the physical efficiency and frequency of its mating, its fertility, and so on. Thus entirely random reproduction in reality is not possible. We can conclude, therefore, that if any of the conditions of the Hardy-Weinberg Law are not met, then the gene pool of a population will not be in equilibrium and there will be an accompanying change in gene frequency for that population. Since it is virtually impossible to have a population existing in genetic equilibrium, even with animals under laboratory conditions, there must then be a continuous process of changing genetic constitutions in all populations. This is ultimately related to evolu-tion in that evolutionary change is not usually automatic, but occurs only when something disturbs the genetic equilibrium.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F26-0696.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "Complete equilibrium in a gene pool is not expected."}

The reaction in this problem is Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+ \\leftrightarrows Cu^2+ + 4NH_3 This indicates that the equilibrium constant can be stated K_d= {[Cu^2+][NH_3]^4} / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 2 \u00d7 10^-13 Here, one is trying to find the ratio of Cu^2+ ion to Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+ in the solution or stated in another way [Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] .

{"question": "Design a computer program to playHexapawn. What is unusual about this program?", "solution": "Hexapawnis played on a 3 \u00d7 3 chess board. There are six pieces - three white pawns and three black pawns. The movements of the pawns are the same as in chess. The initial position is B B B W W W The object of the game is to get a passed pawn i.e. a pawn on the enemy's last rank. The first one to obtain a passed pawn (i.e. to place his pawn to any starting position of his opponent's pawns) wins. Alternatively, if no more moves are possible, (the position is totally blocked), then the person who made the last move is the winner. The squares are num-bered as follows: 123 456 789 The program forHexapawnis an application of cybernetics. The computer records every unfamiliar position in its memory including all the moves that follow. Now assume that the computer loses a game. It erases the move that led to de-feat. As an example: B Computer You W B W Here, with the computer to move, it could win by playing 6 to 9 (or even 1 to 5). However, if it plays 1 to 4 then you can win by moving 5 to 2. If this same position occurs in another game, the computer (assuming it played the losing move in the first game) will not even consider 1 to 4 but will play 6 to 9 or 1 to 5 instead. The computer has learn-ed from the first game. If the computer gets a position from which all moves have been deleted (they all led to defeat) it erases the move that got it there and resigns. In this way it saves only winning sequences of moves. If it plays long enough and encounters a great variety of unfamiliar positions it will become unbeatable. Note that this method of \"learning\" cannot be used to create an unbeatable program in chess. The number of different positions in chess is of astronomical order and the chances of a computer encountering an exactly similar position twice are vanishingly small (apart from the openingand elementary end-game positions).

A mole is defined as weight in grams/molecular weight. The molecular weight of carbon is 12. You started with 500 grams. Therefore, the number of moles of carbon is 500/12. It is stated above, however, that for every 9molesof C, 1 mole of C_6 H_4 Cl_2 was produced. Therefore, the number of moles of C_6 H_4 Cl_2 is 1/9 of the moles of carbon that you started with.

{"question": "The net dipole moment of water is 1.84 debyes and the bond angle is 104.45\\textdegree. What moment can be assigned to each O-H bond?", "solution": "To answer this problem, consider the definition of a dipole, how it is expressed quantitatively, and the geometry of a water molecule. A dipole consists of a positive and negative charge separated by some distance. Quantitatively, it is ex-pressed as dipole moment, which is the charge times the distance between the positive and negative centers. The units are debyes. The geometry of a water molecule is not linear. It is represented by FIG. a. The oxygen atom shares its electrons with the hydrogen atoms; covalent bonding. Because the oxygen atom is electronegative, which means it has a tendency to attract electrons, the shared electrons will spend more time on the oxygen atom than on the hydrogen atoms. Thus, a polar covalent bond exists. The oxygen tends to develop a negative charge because the electrons spend more time on the oxygen atom. Since a water molecule is neutral (overall), the charge on the hydrogen atoms become positively charged (Fig. b). Therefore, a dipole exists. The net dipole is represented by Fig. c. As given, the dipole moment is 1.84 D. One is asked to compute the moment of each OH bond. One can represent the net moment and the OH moment as in Fig. d. The net dipole moment is the longer line and bisects the bond angle of 104.45\\textdegree. The shorter lines represent the components of the net dipole, which comes from each bond. This can be simplified and drawn as Fig. e. This is the representation for one OH bond. The net dipole must be divided by two (1.84/2 = 0.92), since the total number O-H bonds is 2.

{"question": "What are the bacterial factors influencing virulence?", "solution": "Virulence is the degree of ability in micro-organisms to produce disease . Some organisms are more virulent than others. There are several factors influencing virulence. One of these is the production of toxins which are poisonous substances produced by some microorganisms. Both the ability to produce the toxin and the potency of the toxin affect the organism's capability to produce disease. Toxins which are secreted into the surrounding medium during cellular growth are calledexotoxins, and toxins retained in the cell during growth and released upon cell death and lysis are calledendotoxins.Exotoxinsare released into the surrounding medium , e.g., into a can of vegetables containingClostridiumbotulinum (thebacterium causing botulism) or into damaged tissue infected with Clostridium tetani(the bacterium causing tetanus). Both these types of bacteria exhibit difficulty in penetrating the host. However, these bacteria are virulent because of their toxins. When the spatial configuration of the amino acids in a toxin molecule is altered, the toxicity is lost, and the resulting substance is called atoxoid. Both toxins andtoxoidsare able to stimulate the production of anti-toxins, substances made by the host which are capable of neutralizing the toxin.Endotoxinsare liberated only when the microorganism disintegrate and are generally less toxic than exotoxins . They do not formtoxoidsand are usuallypyroqenic,inducinq fever in the host (someexo-toxinsproduce fever also).Exotoxinsare usually associated with gram-positive bacteria whileendotoxinsar associated with the gram-negative ones. Another factor influencing virulence is the ability of bacteria to enter the host and penetrate host tissue. Specific bacterial enzymes are involved . One enzyme that is produced by some of the Clostridia and cocci ishyaluronidase. This enzyme facilitates the spread of the pathogen by aiding itspenetranceinto host tissues. It hydrolyzeshyaluronicacid, an essential tissue \"cement\", and thus increases the permeability of tissue spaces to both the pathogen and its toxic products. The virulence of pathogens is also influenced by their ability to resist destruction by the host. In certain bacteria, this resistance is due to the presence of a non-toxic polysaccharide material which forms a capsule surrounding the bacterial cell. For example,pneumococciare Streptococcus pnemoniaevirulent when capsulated but are oftenavirulent when not capsulated. Capsulatedpnemococciare resistant to phagocytosis (the ingestion and destruction of microorganisms by host phagocytes ), while those without capsules are ingested by leucocytes and destroyed .", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F05-0140.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Production of toxins, ability to enter and penetrate host tissue, and ability to resist destruction by the host"}

The total number of possible combinations is 2^n, where n is the number of heterozygous traits involved in the cross. For the first parent (Tt Yy Ss), n equals 3 and the total combinations is 2^3 or 8. The genotypes of these eight gametes can be de-termined by using a dichotimous branching system (or forkedline method). By following any set of lines from T (or t) to S (or s) one can determine all possible combinations of factors in the following fashion: Gametes Gametes Y S TYS Y S Tys T s TYs t s tYs y S TyS y S tyS S TYs s tys since the second parent is homozygous (ttyyss) there is only 1 possible gamete type, tys, because n = 0 and 2\\textdegree = 1. in the cross: F_1 tys TYS TtYySs TYs TtYyss TyS TtyySs Tys Ttyyss tYS ttYySs tYs ttYyss tyS ttyySs tys ttyyss Phenotypically,TtYySsistall,yellow,smooth; TtYyssistall,yellow,wrinkled; TtyySsistall,green,smooth; Ttyyssistall,green,wrinkled; ttYySsisshort,yellow,smooth; ttYyssisshort,yellow,wrinkled; ttyySsisshort,green,smooth;and ttyyssisshort,green,wrinkled. b)There are two heterozygous traits in the parent with genotype TtyySs, so n equals 2^2. The number of different gametes is or 4. Determining their genotypes: Gametes T-y S TyS s Tys t-y S tyS s tys There are four different gametes from the second parent with genotype ttYySs (2^2 = 4). Gametes Y S tYS t s tYs y S tyS s tys In the cross: F^1 TyS tys Tys tys tYS TtYySS ttYySS TtYySs ttYySs tyS TtyySS ttyySS TtyySs ttyySs tYs TtYySs ttYySs TtYyss ttYyss tys TtyySs ttyySs Ttyyss ttyyss This cross could also be done using the forked line method. View the trihybrid cross as three separate monohybrid crosses. (Since genes segregate independently, we can legitimately do this). Then the genotypic pairs resulting from each cross can occur in any possible combinations with the gene pairs produced in any other cross. The ratios from each cross remain the same as they would if done separately. (Note that this method assumes that you can do the fairly simple monohybrid crosses by inspection, having had sufficient exposure and experience with them.)

{"question": "Estimate the upper limit to the frequency of \"sound\" waves in ordinary matter.", "solution": "The relation v = v/\\lambda ,(1) where \u0475, v, and \\lambda are the frequency, velocity and wave-length of the sound wave, respectively, makes it clear that the higher the frequency the shorter is the wavelength. We are therefore asking what is the shortest wavelength sound can have. The answer is that, when the wavelength becomes shorter than the distance apart of the atoms, the concept of a wave breaks down because there is nothing in between the atoms to oscillate (see figure). The atoms are closest together in solids and highly compressed gases. However, when two atoms are about 10^-8 cm apart they repel one another very strongly and it is difficult to force them any nearer. Consequently, in no material are the atoms or molecules found to be closer together than about 10^-8 cm. This is therefore the order of magnitude of the shortest wavelength of sound. The highest value found for the velocity of sound is about 10^6 cm/sec. Using equation (1). Highest frequency = (Largest wave velocity) / (Shortest wavelength) = (10^6 / 10^-8) approximately = 10^14 sec^-1 approximately. This is much larger than the highest frequency yet produced experimentally, which is 2.5 x 10^10 sec^-1. The reader should note the character of these arguments, which are not precise calculations, but rather intelligent guesses. We have made it very plausible that the highest frequency is not very much bigger than 10^14 sec^-1. It is conceivable that, by applying a very high pressure to the right gas or solid, we could force its atoms a little closer than 10^-8 cm and achieve a velocity of sound a little larger than 10^6 cm/sec. In this way we might perhaps realize a frequency of, say, 2 \u00d7 10^14 sec^-1. We should be very surprised, though, if we ever pushed the frequency up to 10^15 sec^-1. In fact we know that there is a limit to the pro-cedure, because there is reason to believe that, when the pressure on a substance becomes extremely large, its atoms break up into separate electrons and nuclei.", "images": ["images/D26-0833_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Physics/D26-0833.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "10^14 sec^-1 approximately"}

{"question": "What weight of sulfur must combine with aluminum to form 600 lbs of aluminum sulfide?", "solution": "In this problem one wants to find out how much reactant (sulfur) was needed to produce a given amount of product (aluminum sulfide). The balanced equation for this reaction is: 2Al + 3S \\rightarrow AL_2 S_3 The first method for solving this problem is the pro-portion method.

The second method for solving the problem is by the mole method. We see that 1 mole of Al_2 S_3 requires moles of S. Therefore, if one can calculate the actual number of moles present of 1 substance one can obtain the number of moles of the other substance by setting up a ratio. Then, knowing the number of moles, one can calculate the weight by using the equation moles = weight/M.W. One is given that 600 lbs. of Al_2 S_3 are present. Therefore, the number of moles is 600/150 = 4 pound moles of Al_2 S_3. Setting up the ratio, [(S) / (Al_2 S_3 )] = (3/1) = (x/4) it is seen that x = 12 lb. moles of S.

{"question": "Are all antibodies structurally and functionally similar? Explain.", "solution": "All antibodies are proteins and are referred to as immunoglobulins. Five major classes of immunoglobulins can be distinguished based on their character-istic structures and separate functional roles: IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE. IgG immunoglobulins constitute about 80% of all the antibodies in the blood serum. These are the major anti-bodies involved in the destruction of invading micro-organisms. IgM immunoglobulins appear first in response to an antigen; they are later replaced by IgG. IgA im immunoglobulins are found in secretions such as saliva and tears and are involved in the defense of body cavities such as the mouth and vagina. The function of IgD is still unknown, while IgE is thought to be involved in allergic reactions. There are thus five basic types of immunoglobulins. But we are certainly exposed to more than five different antigens. What distinguishes one immunoglobulin molecule from the next? Let us look at the structure of an IgG molecule. It is composed of four polypeptide chains; two heavy chains (mol. wt. \\sim 53,000) and two light chains (mol. wt. \\sim 22,500). In a given IgG molecule, both heavy chains are identical and both light chains are identical. The polypeptide chains are held together by disulfide (\\rule{1em}{1pt}S\\rule{1em}{1pt}S\\rule{1em}{1pt}) linkages to form a Y-shaped molecule: The ends of each arm of the IgG molecule contain an active site which can combine with a specific antigen. Thus, two identical binding sites permit each antibody molecule to form a complex with two antigens. Both light and heavy chains contain two regions: a \"constant\" region which has very similar amino acid sequences in all immuno-globulins, and a \"variable\" region which has different amino acid sequences for each type of antibody. This variability accounts for the specificity of antibodies- that is, one particular antibody molecule can bind only one particular kind of antigen. The specific sequence of amino acids in the variable region at the end of each arm of the antibody molecule determines the spatial configuration of the active site which will only bind one particular antigen.", "images": ["images/F14-0361_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F14-0361.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "All antibodies are not structurally and functionally similar.

{"question": "Describe briefly the Darwin-Wallace theory of natural selection. What is meant by \"survival of the fittest\"? Do you thinkthis applies to human populations today?", "solution": "The Darwin-Wallace theory of natural selection states that a significantpart of evolution is dictated by natural forces, which select for survivalthose organisms that can respond best to them. Since more organismsare born than can be accommodated by the environment, there mustbe chosen among the large numbers born the limited number to live andreproduce. Variation is characteristic of all animals and plants, and it isthis variety which provides the means for this choice. Those individuals whoare chosen for survival will be the ones with the most and best adaptivetraits. These include the ability to compete successfully for food, water, shelter, and other essential elements, also the ability to reproduce andperpetuate the species, and the ability to resist adverse natural forces, which are the agents of selection. Essential to the theory of natural selection are the ideas of the \"strugglefor existence\" and \"survival of the fittest\". Because the resources ofthe environment are naturally limited, individuals must struggle among themselvesfor food and space. Those individuals with the traits that are bestsuited for the given environment will survive and multiply, while otherswill slowly decline in number or disappear completely. Since the naturalforces are constantly operating and changing, struggle for survival goeson forever and the fittest of the competitors survive. Survival of the fittest holds true for human popu-lations, but it is less obviousamong human beings than lower organisms. Whereas it is commonto see wild dogs fighting each other for a piece of food, it is less commonto see two human beings fighting for the same reason. Among humanbeings, the problems of food and shelter have been conquered successfully, such as by farming or by raising cattle.

{"question": "The biomass of each trophic level is usually much less than that of the preceding lower trophic level. Define the term biomass and explain the factors that determine the biomass of trophic levels in ecosystems.", "solution": "Biomass is the total mass of the living material present in a certain category, whether it is a trophic level or an ecosystem. The distribution of biomass within some ecosystems can be represented by a pyramid, with the first trophic level (producers) at the base and the last consumer level at the apex. In general, the decrease of energy at each successive trophic level means that less of the biomass can be supported at each level. If the animals of each trophic level were of the same size, they would have to be rarer and rarer toward the top of the pyramid where energy is in shortest supply. Since the animals at the top are usually larger, they are sharing an even smaller supply of energy. The animals high in food chains therefore, must be few, and the pyramid of biomass is a direct consequence of this. Thus the total mass of carnivores in a given community is almost always less than the total mass of herbivores. The size, growth rate and longevity of the species at the various trophic levels of a community are important in determining whether or not the pyramidal model will hold for the biomass of the community. In fact, biomass pyramids of different communities vary greatly. The variability of biomass pyramids exist because the plant producer organisms exhibit extreme variability in their ability to undergo photosynthesis. The small algae of some ocean communities can greatly outproduce most land plants on a per gram basis. This is also because of the high metabolic and reproductive rates of algae. Consequently, they are able to support a pro-portionately much larger biomass of herbivores. The production of ocean herbivores is still only about ten percent (due to ecological efficiency) that of algae. But the biomass of the herbivores is increased because the turnover rate (the rate at which they are consumed and replaced) of the algae is very high. Biomass normally tends to decrease with each successive trophic level, forming the shape of a pyramid. Soma communities show an inverse pyramid biomass relationship, such as the case of open ocean algae primary producers.", "images": ["images/F30-0775_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F30-0775.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "Biomass is the total mass of the living material present in a certain category."}

To do this, one needs the initial concentration of the liquid ammonia, which can be found from the density, (density = mass/volume). It is given that density = 0.68 g/ml. The molecular weight of ammonia (NH_3) is 17 g/mole. For the correct units, con-vert 0.68 g/ml to 680 g/l. Thus concentration (moles/liter) = (680 g/l) / (17 g/mole) = 40 molar NH_3. Let x = [NH_4^+]. From the chemical reaction, it can be seen that NH_4^+ and NH_2^- are formed inequimolaramounts, which means [NH_4^+] = [NH_2^-], so that [NH_2^-] = x. If the original [NH_3] = 40 M, and x moles/liter form [NH_4^+] and [NH_2^-] each, then, at equilibrium, [NH_3] = 40 - x.

{"question": "In what ways do ferns resemble seed plants? In what respects do they differ from them?", "solution": "ThePterophyte(ferns) and theSpermophyte(seed plants- gymnosperms and angiosperms) are alike in a number of respects. They are both terrestrial plants and as such have adapted certain similar anatomical structures. The roots, of both plants aredefferentiatedinto root cap, an apicalmeristem, a zone of elongation and a zone of maturation. Their stems have a protective epidermis, supporting, and vascular tissues: and their leaves have veins,chlorenchymawith chlorophylls, a protective epidermis andstomatae. The ferns also resemble the seed plants in that thesporophyteis the dominant generation. The characteristics that distinguish ferns from the seed plants include the structure of the vascular system, the location of the sporangia, the absence of seeds, the structure and transport of sperm, and the patterns of reproduction and development. Unlike the seed plants, ferns have onlytracheidsin their xylem and no vessels. They bear their sporangia in clusters on their leaves (fronds), in contrast to the seed plants which carry their sporangia on specialized, non-photo-synthetic organs, such as the cone scales of a gymnosperm. The ferns produce no seeds and the embryo develops directly into the newsporophytewithout passing through any protected dormant stage as seen in the seed plants. The ferns retain flagellated sperm and require moisture for their transport and subsequent fertilization. The seed plants, on the other hand, have evolved a mechanism ofgameticfusion by pollination, i.e., the growth of a pollen tube. The pollen tube eliminates the need for moisture and provides a means for the direct union of sex cells. The ferns also differ from the seed plants in their life cycle. While in both, thesporophyteis the dominant generation, the fern gametophyte is an inde-pendent photosynthetic organism whereas the seed plant's gametophyte, bearing no chlorophyll, is parasitic upon thesporophyte. Also, the gametophyte of the seed plant is highly reduced in structure. The cycad (a gymnosperm) male gametophyte, for instance, consists of only three cells.

{"question": "Define stack, queue, anddeque. What characteristics of these three list structures make each of them useful for different applications?", "solution": "A queue is a type of list structure with the lim-itation that items may be added or deleted at either end, but not in the middle. The term queue is also used in con-nection with computer memory to mean a group of items chained together sequentially by addresses. But here, we will dis-cuss the queue as a way of entering data at the macro level. Queue is a general term which describes several types of lists. One type of queue is known as a FIFO queue, which stands for \"first-in-first out.\" Items that are added to a FIFO queue at one end are removed at the other. The other type of queue is a LIFO queue, which stands for \"last-in- first-out.\" This type of queue is known as a stack. Stacks have the property that the items are removed in the reverse of the order in which they are entered. In addition, a stack allows insertions and deletions to take place only at one end. The termdequeis an acronym for \"double-ended queue\", in which items may be added to, or deleted from, either end. This type of list may be constructed with a double set of pointers, one to keep track of items moving up the list, and one to keep track of items moving down the list. One sample application of queues is in the simulation of customer arrival at a ticket window. New customers coming up to the window can be placed at one end of a queue which represents the line of prospective ticket buyers. When the tickets are bought, the customer is removed from the list at the opposite end. Using this concept, the owner of the ticket booth can simulate the flow of customers and plan his business activities accordingly. Stacks are especially useful in processing data struc-tures such as trees. Stacks can also be used when converting expressions in algebraic notation to Polish expressions. Recursive procedures, sometimes found in PL/1 programs, use the notion of stacks to allocate additional memory space for themselves.

{"question": "Describe the bonding in linear, covalent BeCl_2 and planar, covalent BCI_3. What is the difference in the hybrid orbitals used?", "solution": "The solution to this problem involves the hybridization of orbitals. Once this is clear, the bonding in BeCl_2 and BCI_3 will follow. Quantum theory deals with independent orbitals, such as 2s and 2p. This can be applied to a species, like hydrogen, with only 1 electron. However, with atoms that contain more than one electron, different methods must be used. For example, the presence of a 2s electron perturbs a 2p electron, and vice versa, such that a 2s electron makes a 2p electron take on some s-like characteristics. The result is that the hydrogenlike 2s and 2p orbitals are replaced by new orbitals, that contain the combined characteristics of the original orbitals. These new orbitals are called hybrid orbitals. The number of hybrid orbitals resulting from hybridization equals the number of orbitals being mixed together. For example, if one mixes an s and p orbital, one obtains two sp hybrid orbitals. One s and two p = three sp^2 orbitals. One s with three p = four sp^3 orbitals, sp orbitals are linear. sp^2 orbitals assume a planar shape and sp^3 orbitals assume a tetrahedral shape. Solving:It is given that BeCl_2 is linear and co-valent. Since sp orbitals are linear, Be undergoes sp hybridization. If something is linear, the bond angle is 180\\textdegree. By understanding hybridization, one also knows the geometry of the molecule. A diagram of the bonding resembles Fig. A.

{"question": "Name each of the following alkanes. Indicated which, if any, are isomers.", "solution": "Isomers are related compounds that have the same molecular formula but different structural formulas. Isomerism is not possible among the alkanes until there are enough carbon atoms to permit more than one arrangement of the carbon chain. To name the above compounds, one uses a set rules to provide each compound with a clear name. These rules for nomenclature are the IUPAC rules (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) , and are referred to as systematic nomenclature. One of the rules of the IUPAC system is to choose the largest chain of carbon atoms in the molecule and call it parent compound. Thus, (a) has a 6 carbon parent chain with methyl groups bonded to the second and fourth carbon atoms of the parent chain. There exists, also, an ethyl group bonded to the third carbon atom. As such, the name of this organic molecule is 2,4-dimethy1-3- ethylhexane. (b) has 5 carbon parent molecule and 2 methyl groups on carbon number 3. Therefore, the name is 3,3-dimethylpentane. (c) has a 5 carbon parent molecule with 2 methyl groups bonded to the third carbon of the parent chain. Therefore, the name of this structure becomes 3,3 dimethylpentane. (d) has a 5 carbon parent molecule, and 2 methyl groups attached to carbon numbers 2 and 3. Therefore, the name is 2,3-dimethylpentane. (e) has a 5 carbon parent molecule, and 2 methyl groups attached to carbon number 3. Therefore, the name is 3,3-dimethylpentane. (f) has a 6 carbon parent molecule, and 2 methyl groups attached to carbon numbers 3 and 4. Therefore, the name is 3,4-dimethylhexane. To find which compounds are isomers, one counts the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms contained in the molecule.

The specific rate constant can be found from a given set of data. The rate with given concentrations is obtainable from the specific rate law. From this, a rate-controlling step can be guessed at. Proceed as follows: (a)To write the rate law, note that, in general, the rate = r = k[A]x[B]^y [C]^z, where the brackets indicate concentrations of A, B, and C, k = specific rate constant and the exponents (x, y, and z) are the orders ofthe re-action with respect to each reactant. The order of a chemical reaction is the number of particles needed to form the activated complex or transition state. To find the actual law, you must determine these exponents. To do this, consult the data. You are told the actual rate of the re-action, since you are given - dA/dt , which is an indication of rate. Thus, to find the order, see what happens when one of the concentrations is changed. In going from (1) to (2) , the concentration of A is doubled from 1.00 to 2.00 . Notice - dA/dt also doubles, from 1.00 to 2.00, which means the re-action is first order, x = 1, with respect to A. In going from (2) to (3), [B] goes from 1.00 to 2.00 (doubles). But notice, - dA/dt quadruples going from 2.00 to 8.00. Thus, the reaction is second order, y = 2, with respect to B. In going from (3) to (4) , [C] is doubled going from 2.00 to 4.00, while - dA/dt remains constant at 8.00. Thus, the reaction is zero order, z = 0, with respect to C, i.e., rate doesn't depend on [C]. You then have, r = k[A][B]^2[C]^0 orr = k[A][B]^2 for the experimental rate law expression. (b)To find k, substitute any of the four sets of data in the experimental rate law expression. rate = (-dA/dt) = k[A][B]^2 For example, let us take the data from line (1). You have 1.00 mole/liter- sec = k[1.00 mole/liter] [1.00 mole/liter]^2 , or k = 1.00. Thus, the value of the specific rate constant k is 1.00 liter^2/mole2- sec. (c)To find the rate of the reaction at the concen-trations [A] = 1, [B] = 2, and [c] =3, substitute these values into the rate law, r = k [A][B]^2, Thus, r = (1)[1][2]^2 = 4.0 moles/liter-sec. (d)You can use previous information gained in this problem to speculate about what the rate-controlling step must be. From part (a) you know the rate does not depend on [C]. Thus, C cannot be involved in the slow step. The rate of the reaction is influenced by [A] and [B], however.

{"question": "(a) isobutane and isobutylene (b) sec-butyl alcohol and n-heptane.", "solution": "To distinguish between two compounds, try to select for a characterization test. Begin by writing the structures of the compounds involved. You see that isobutylene is an alkene, and that isobutane is an alkane. Thus, you should be able to distinguish isobutylene from isobutane by an addition reaction. Addition reactions are characteristic of alkenes and other unsaturated compounds. When Br_2/CCI_4 , a reddish brown solution, is in contact with an alkene, the following reaction occurs: When the alkene consumes the Br_2, the red color disappears. Thus, alkenes can be detected by their ability to decolorize the red solution of Br_2/CCI_4 . You can also use a cold, dilute, neutral permanganate solution, the Baeyer test, instead of Br_2/CCI_4 to detect the presence of an alkene. Permanganate solution is purple colored, upon reaction with an alkene, the purple disappears and is replaced by a brown manganese dioxide precipitate. The reaction can be written Alkenes do give this reaction. Thus, you now have two simple tests to distinguish isobutane from isobutylene.

{"question": "What is meant by a cloaca and what is its relation to the mammals?", "solution": "Chordates, except for mammals and teleosts, have a cloaca. A cloaca is a common duct through which passes the reproductive, digestive and excretory matters. In the frogs, for example, sperm cells pass from the testes into the kidneys and down the excretory ducts to the cloaca. The reproductive system and the excretory system are very closely related. The evolutionary trend in the vertebrates, with regard to the cloaca, has been one toward increasing separation between the reproductive and excretory systems. Mammals have, instead of a cloaca, ureters which release their exaretory material (i.e., urine) into a urinary bladder. The urethra carries the urine from the bladder to the outside. In the mammals, however, sperms also pass through the urethra. Thus, although there is far more separation in mammalian males than in fish or frogs, the mammalian reproductive and excretory systems still share the urethra and hence do not have separate openings to the outside.

{"question": "Explain what is meant by a Hash Table, and a Hashing func-tion. Explain various methods of inserting entries in the table.", "solution": "A Hash Table is a type of data structure in the computer memory. Stocks, lists, arrays, etc., are other examples of data structures. The advantage of a hash table over many other types of data structures is that the operations of insertion, dele-tion, searching, etc., are much more efficient, especially when the number of elements to be inserted in the structure is extremely large or initially the number of elements is not known. In essence, a Hash Table is a sequential block of memory space set aside for the table. Let us assume we reserve 1000 memory words for the Hash Table. Now, in order to determine where we should insert a par-ticular data item, within any one of the 1000 words, we make use of a Hashing function. A Hashing function can be any arbitrary function selected by us, which operates on the given data item, and extracts from it a memory address, within our reserved block of storage. For example, if our data items are names of persons, we could define our Hashing Function arbitrarily as follows: a) Give weights in ascending order from 1 to 26 to each of the letters of the alphabet from A to Z. i.e., A = 1, B = 2, ..., Y = 25, Z = 26. b) Add up the weights of the letters in a given data item (Eg., if our data item is the name NANCY the sum of weights is: N + A + N + C + Y = 14 + 1 + 14 + 3 + 25 = 57). c) Divide the sum by 7. d) Multiply by 10. e) Round off to the nearest integer, to get the value of the Hashing function. Thus, once a value of the Hashing function is obtained, this corresponds to the position, within our reserved block of memory, into which the data item is to be stored. Observe that the important aspect about hashing func-tions is not how it is devised, but whether it distributes the different data items quite uniformly within our reserved memory block. Conversely, if we want to search whether a given data item is in the Hash Table or not, we subject the data item to the same Hashing Function and obtain an address. We can then immediately access the address thus found and check if the data item we are looking for is in that location. Many times it happens that the Hashing function calcu-lates the same memory address for more than one data item. Thus, when we go to the address location, we may find that there already is some other data item there. Or, while search-ing, we may find that there is some other data item at the loca-tion calculated instead of the one which we are searching for. In this case we adopt any one of three methods: a) We multiply the data item by a pre-determined fixed constant and re- valuate the Hashing Function, and see if now we find an empty location for insertion, or the given data item while searching. We repeat the process till success, using a set of pre-determined constants. b) Beginning at the calculated location, start a sequential scan up or down the table till we either succeed or come to the end of the table. c) Bucket Hashing: Associated with each of the memory words in our Hash Table is a pointer. When a Hash function calculates an address and we find that the addressed location is already full, we search for any other vacant memory location, say within the general storage area of the memory, outside the Hash Table block. Data is stored in the first empty location and its address is stored into the pointer position of our calculated hash table address. e.g., NANCY and FRED has the same hash function, say 10. NANCY was previously stored in location 10. Now to store FRED with hash function 10 we search for vacant storage. Store FRED in that location and the address of that loca-tion is placed in the pointer position of NANCY. We now store our data item in this empty location. If a third data item also happens to have the Hash Table address, we search for another empty location in the general storage area, store the data in it, and move the pointer of the second data item to this third data item, forming a long list or bucket. While searching too, we search down the bucket.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G07-0162.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "A Hash Table is a type of data structure in the computer memory.

{"question": "Discuss some properties and functions of (a) carbohydrates (b) lipids, (c) proteins and (d) nucleic acids.", "solution": "(a) Carbohydrates are made up of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen, and have the general formula (CH_2O)_n. Carbohydrates can be classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides or polysac-charides. The monosaccharides (\"simple sugars\") are further categorized according to the number of carbons in the molecule. Trioses contain 3 carbons: pentoses contain 5 carbons (i.e. ribose, dexyribose): and hexoses contain 6 carbons (i.e. glucose, fructose, galactose). The hexoses, which exist as straight chains or rings, are important building blocks for disaccharides and the more complex carbohydrates. Disaccharides, important in nutrition, are chemical combinations of two monosaccharides: Lactose = glucose + galactose Sucrose (table sugar) = glucose + fructose Maltose = glucose + glucose As can be seen by the double arrows, the reverse of this reaction, hydrolysis, is also possible. Oligosaccharide means \"few sugars\" and is arbitrarily defined as com-pounds which upon hydrolysis yield 2 - 10 monosaccharides. Polysaccharides are complex carbohydrates made up of many monosaccharides bonded by glycosidic linkages. These long chains are formed by dehydration synthesis. They also can be broke down into monosaccharide units by hydrolysis. There are many complex polysaccharides that are of great biological significance. Their primary functions include both storage and structural properties. Examples of these are: starches (principal storage product of animals), and cellulose (major supporting material in plants). These are all polymers of glucose. (b) Lipids are also composed principally of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. However, they can also contain other elements, particularly phosphorus and nitrogen, and typically contain a much smaller proportion of oxygen than do carbohydrates. Lipids are insoluble in water. There are many known lipids, the most common include the fats, the phospholipids and the steroids. Fats are composed of two different types of compounds: glycerol (an alcohol) and fatty acids (organic compounds with a carboxyl group . Each molecule of fat contains one glycerol molecule and three fatty acids joined together by dehydration reactions. There are basically two groups of fats: the saturated (those fats which have the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms and therefore have no carbon to carbon double or triple bonds) and the unsaturated (those which have at least one carbon to carbon double or triple bond). Unsaturated fats are an important part of our diet due to their storage capabilities. Phospho-lipids are composed of glycerol, fatty acids, phoshoric acid and usually a nitrogenous compound. They are important components of many cellular membranes. Steroids are classified as lipids because their solubility characteristics are similar to those of fats and phospholipids - they are all insoluble in water, but soluble in ether. However, steroids differ structurally from fats and phospholipids - they are not based on the bonding together of fatty acids and an alcohol. Instead, they are composed of four interlocking rings of carbon atoms with various side groups attached to the rings: They are very important biologically. Steriods include the sex hormones, various other hormones and some vitamins. In addition they are also important structural elements in living cells, especially plants. c) Proteins are much more complex than either carbohydrates or lipids. They are made up of the four essential elements: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen bonded together to form compounds called amino acids. Some amino acids contain sulfur. The amino acid is represented as: where R is a chain which can bevery simple (as in the amino acid glycine where R=H) or it can be very complex (as in tryptophan where R contains two ring structures). Proteins are long and complex polymers of varying combinations of the twenty amino acids which are formed by condensation reactions between the -COO^- and -NH_3^+ groups of the amino acid building blocks. The bonds formed by these reactions are called peptide bonds. A dipeptide is a molecule with two amino acids joined together by one peptide bond. A tripeptide refers to three linked amino acids. Oligopeptides, which includes tripeptides, is the term for a short chain of amino acids. Polypeptides are the polymer of amino acids and may contain 1000 amino acids. Finally, a protein is one or more polypeptide chains coiled or folded into complex three- dimensional configurations. Often a metal ion or organic molecule is an integral part of the protein structure. Proteins are found in every part of the cell and are an integral part in both the structure and function of living things. They play an important part in many of the chemical reactions that occur within cells because the enzymes that catalyze these reactions are proteins themselves. Proteins also function as the structural and binding materials of organisms. Hair, fingernails, muscle, cartilage, tendons and ligaments are all structures which contain large amounts of proteins. d) Nucleic acids, as their name implies, are found primarily in the nucleus. There are two types of nucleic acid: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). DNA and RNA molecules are very long chains composed of repeating subunits called nucleotides. A nucleotide is composed of any one of the following five nitrogenous bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine (only in DNA) or uracil (only in RNA), a five carbon sugar (ribose in RNA, deoxyribose in DNA) and a phosphate group. Both DNA and RNA are composed of many nucleotides linked together and are called poly-nucleotides or nucleic acids. In a polynucleotide, any two nucleotides are linked together by a dehydration re-action between the phosphate group of one nucleotide and the sugar group of another. The bases are attached to the sugars. Nucleic acids primarily function in heredity and governing the synthesis of many different kinds of proteins and other substances present in organisms. Chromosomes and genes are predominantly composed of DNA. Some DNA is also found in the mitochondria and the chloroplasts. Large quanitites of RNA are present in the nucleoli, the cytoplasm, and the ribosomes of most cells.", "images": ["images/F01-0024_files/image002.jpg", "images/F01-0024_files/image004.jpg", "images/F01-0024_files/image006.jpg", "images/F01-0024_files/image008.jpg", "images/F01-0024_files/image010.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F01-0024.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Carbohydrates are made up of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen, and can be classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides or polysaccharides.

This can be seen from the equation of state, PV =nRTor V = (nRT/ P ) , where R = universal gas constant, n = moles, and V = volume. When P and T are constant, RT/P is a constant, and V varies directly with n. Thus, in this problem you can discuss volumes in terms of fractions decomposed.

When heat is added at constant volume, all the heat goes into increasing the kinetic energy of the mo-lecules. However, with constant pressure, the volume can expand. This means the added heat must do two things. It must be able to increase the kinetic energy of the molecules AND do work against the pressure to expand the volume. The constant pressure case would require more heat. In fact, the difference between C_p andC_v, where C_p = heat capacity at constant pressure, andC_v= heat capacity at constant volume, is the universal gas constant R.

{"question": "NAD+ and NADP+ play important roles in reactions associated with metabolism. Discuss these roles.", "solution": "In a dehydrogenation reaction, the electrons removed from a substance cannot exist freely but must be transferred to another compound called an electron acceptor. Both nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) are electron aceeptors. The functional part of both NAD+ and NADP+ is the nicotinamide ring, which accepts one hydrogen atom and two electrons to become NADH and NADPH respectively NAD+ and NADP+ serve as electron acceptors in the dehydrogenation of substances with the secondary alcohol arangement. Although NADP+ only differs from NAD+ in having three rather than two phosphate groups on the R group, most dehydrogenases require either NAD+ or NADP+ to be present as a coenzyme and will not operate with the other one. NAD+ is used as an electron acceptor in glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and fatty acid oxidation. NADP+ is used as an electron acceptor in the light reaction of photo-synthesis, and in the pentose phosphate pathway (the source of pentoses, necessary constituents of nucleotides). We thus see that the function of NAD+ or NADP+ is to accept hydrogen atoms and electrons and to store energy released from oxidized substances in the form of NADH or NADH. The reverse is true for NADH or NADPH; that is, their function is to give up hydrogen atoms and electrons and energy to reducible compounds. For example, the hy-drogen atoms of NADH in the electron transport chain are ultimately transferred to oxygen, producing high energy phosphate bonds in the form of ATP along the chain. The oxidation of one molecule of NADH yields 3 phosphate bonds; thus the 8 NADHs produced in the TCA cycle yield 24 phos-phate bonds. NADPH is formed from the reduction of NADP+ in the light reaction of photosynthesis. It is subsequently utilized in the dark reactions of carbohydrate synthesis, in which carbon dioxide is used in the production of hexose molecules. To produce one hexose molecule (a 6-carbon sugar) , 12 NADPH and 18 ATP are required, both of which are the products of the light reactions. Thus, both NAD+, NADH and NADP+, NADPH have major importance in reactions associated with metabolic and catabolic functions.", "images": ["images/F03-0086_files/image002.jpg", "images/F03-0086_files/image004.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F03-0086.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "NAD+ and NADP+ serve as electron acceptors in the dehydrogenation of substances.

{"question": "The property of skeletal muscle contraction in which the mechanical response to one or more successive stimuli is added to the first is known as summation. What is the underlying explanation for this phenomenon?", "solution": "A possible explanation of this phenomenon, based on the role of calcium in excitation-contraction coupling, is that the amount of calcium released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum during a single action poten-tial is sufficient to inhibit only some of the troponin-tropomyosin in the muscle. Multiple stimulation would then release more calcium so that more troponin-tropomyosin would be inhibited, allowing for further contraction. However, the truth is that more than enough calcium is released by the first action potential to inhibit all the troponin-tropomyosin, so this proposal must be discarded. The explanation of summation involves the passive elastic properties of the muscle. Tension is transmitted from the cross bridges through the thick and thin fila-ments, across the Z lines, and eventually through the extracellular connective tissue and the tendons to the bone. All these structures have a certain amount of elasticity, analogous to a spring that is placed between the contractile components of the muscle and the external object. In the muscle, the contractile elements in their fully active state begin to stretch the passive elastic structures immediately following calcium release. Only when the elastic structures are all taut, can increasing contraction by the muscle occur. Summation occurs because a second stimulus is given, very close in time to the first, while the elastic structures are still a bit taut and not yet slack. Under this condition, the active state of the contractile proteins is maintained and the result is contractions that are stronger than any single simple twitch. Should sustained stimulation occur, the elastic elements would never have time to relax at all, and it is at this point that maximal force by the muscle fibers is attained; the individual contractions are indistinquishably fused into a single sustained contraction known as tetanus, (see accompanying figure) If stimula-tion of the muscle continues at this frequency, the ulti-mate result will be fatigue and possibly complete cessation of activity due to exhaustion of nutrients. It is not surprising to note that cardiac muscle has an extremely long refractory period, allowing the elastic components to relax and thus avoiding tetanus, which would result in death due to loss of pumping action of the heart.", "images": ["images/F19-0473_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F19-0473.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Summation occurs because a second stimulus is given, very close in time to the first, while the elastic structures are still a bit taut and not yet slack.

{"question": "An observer on earth finds that the lifetime of a neutron is 6.42 \u00d7 10^2 s. What will the lifetime of a neutron be as measured by an observer in a spacecraft moving past the laboratory at a speed of 2 \u00d7 10^8 m/s?", "solution": "If we measure the time required for the neutron to decay, first from the laboratory, and then relative to the neutron, we do not record the same time. The decay of the neutron takes longer for the observer in the lab. It is known that the faster the observer moves with respect to an event the slower the event seems to take place. This phenomenon is called time dilation and is a result of the laws of relativistic kinematics. The lifetime of an un-stable (i.e. decaying) particle will therefore be longer when viewed from the rocket. The formula relating thelifetime t_R observed from the rocket to one t_L, observed in the laboratory is t_R = [1 / {1 - (v2/ c^2)} ] t_L where v is the speed of the rocket with respect to the laboratory.

{"question": "Trace the movement of the integers 4, 3, 5, 1, 2 as they are sorted in ascending order with the bubble sort. Can you give a general formula for the time needed for sorting N numbers in the best case? In the worst case?", "solution": "The bubble sort compares each pair of adjacent elements in a list.

In this fashion, the larger elements are \"bubbled\\textquotedblright down the list, while the smaller elements move to the head of the list.

No sorting method can do any better than this. However, in the worst case, the bubble sort makes a maximum of N (N - 1) / 2 comparisons, just like other sequential sorting methods. The worst case is realized when the data are in the opposite order from the order you wish to have. For example, if we wish to sort the integers 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 into ascending order, the bubble sort will make 10 switches. 4, 3, 2, 1, 54 switches 3, 2, 1, 4, 53 switches 2, 1, 3, 4, 52 switches 1, 2, 3, 4, 51switches 10 switches total", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G07-0153.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "In the best case, the bubble sort makes only one pass through the list.

{"question": "How is an ARRAY declared inPL/I? Explain using examples.", "solution": "Every identifier to be used as an array name requires explicit declaration. The declaration must also de-fine the subscripting to be used whenthe array elements are referenced. For declaration of an array variable, the declar-ation has the following format: DCL ARRAY NAME (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES) DATA ATTRIBUTES; Array names can be any variable names and every element within thearray is referenced by the array name declared. The use of the dimension attribute in an array declara-tion is governedby the following rules. 1. The dimension attribute has the form of one or more boundary specificationsenclosed within a pair of parentheses. If two or more boundaryspecifications are used in the list, they are separated by commas. The number of boundary speci-fications in the dimension attributeestablishes dimensional-ity of the array variable. 2. A boundary specification is composed of two, possib-ly signed, decimalinteger constants, separated by a colon. The first integer value specifiesthe lower bound and the second the upper bound of that particulardimension. For example DECLAREA(-1:2, 8:10); In the above, A is the name of the array. It could have been any other nametoo, e.g., NANCY, PETE, POOR, etc.. But the same name cannot beused to refer to more than one data struc-ture or data item. Also note thatin the above, A is a two dimensional array as there are two boundary, specifications. The first subscript may assume any one of the integer values-1, 0, 1, or 2. The second subscript may assume any one of the integervalues in the range of 8 through 10. Thus, in the first subscript thereare 4 elements and the second sub-script has 3 elements so the arrayA contains 4 \u00d7 3=12 elements. 3. In a boundary specification, the lower bound must have its value lessthan or equal to the value of the upper bound. The dimension attributes, e.g.,(3:5), (-3:0, 0:3), (9:9, 1:1), arewell formed. But, (5:3) is not well formed because the lower bound is greater thanthe higher bound. If the lower bound is not specified it is assumed to havea numeric value of one. For example, the dimension attributes (17,26,5) and (1:17, 1:26, 1:5) areequivalent. 4. The dimension attribute must always appear as the first attribute followingthe variable name declared. Using the above 4 rules a well-formed declare statement can be written. E.g., consider the following declare state-ment: DECLAREB(5,12) FIXED DEC(8,3); The above statement is a well-formeddeclarestatement. It establishes a twodimensional array B, with upper bounds 5 and 12. The elements are fixeddecimal numbers with preci-sion of the type XXXXX.XXX. However, thefollowing declare statement is wrong. DECLARE BFIXED(5,12) DEC(8,3); The machine would be unable to distinguish between dimension and precisionattributes when written as above. The declara-tions for more than onearray can sometimes be condensed. For example, consider the following: DECLARE (A, B, MATRIX) (10, 1:9, -2:5) FLOAT; DECLARE (X FIXED, Y FLOAT) (17, 20); This is how the array structure is declared. In the above, A, B and MATRIX are3-dimensional arrays with 10\u00d79\u00d78=720 elements in each. All theelements have a Float-ing Point number representation. X and Y are both 2-dimensional arrays, each of 17 \u00d7 20 = 340 elements.

{"question": "The ability to roll the tongue into almost a complete circle is conferred by a dominant gene, while its recessive allele fails to confer this ability.

We know that if a gene is dominant for a trait, it will always be expressed if it is present. Since the son cannot roll his tongue, he cannot possess the dominant gene for this trait, and his genotype must be rr. This means that, each parent must have at least one recessive allele to donate to their son. Also, each parent must have a dominant allele for this trait because they have the ability to roll their tongues. Thus the genotype of parents for this trait must be Rr. We can illustrate this by looking at the mating of two such parents, The offspring will be obtained in the following ratios F1/4 RR,Homozygous dominant;tongue roller. 1/2 Rr,Heterozygous;tongue roller. 1/4rr,Homozygous recessive;non-tongue roller.

{"question": "In an electrolytic cell, a liter of a 1M aqueous solution of MnO_4^- is reduced at the cathode. Determine the number of faradays required for each of the following to be made a) a solution that is .01 M MnO_4^2- ; b) 1 gram of MnO_2 ; c) 1 gram-equivalent of Mn metal.", "solution": "For each part, you need to write the reaction that occurs. The masses of substances produced during the process are proportional to their equivalent weights. The unit electrical equivalent = 1 Faraday or 1F. One Faraday = 96,500 coul and is capable of reducing one equivalent positive charge, an equivalent positive charge contains Avogadro's number of individual unit charges. You proceed as follows: reaction is MnO_4^- + e^- \\rightarrow Mn_4^2-.One electron is being transferred. You want [MnO_4^2-] = .01 M . Since the solution has a volume of 1 liter, .01 M = .01 moles, since M = molarity = moles / liter. Due to the fact that only 1 electron is transferred, only one Faraday is needed to reduce a mole of MnO_4^-, since it would require only a mole of electrons. You need only, however, .01 moles of MhO_4^2- . Since a mole of MnO_4^2- is formed from every mole of MnO_4^- oxidized you need to reduce .01 moles of MnO_4^2- . To do this, requires, therefore, .01 F . Mn0_4^- + 4H^+ + 3e^- \\rightarrow MnO_2 + 2H-_2O . Here, 3 electrons are required to reduce MnO_4^- to MnO_2 . Thus, one Faraday can only reduce (1 / 3) of a mole of MnO_4^-,. Recall, one Faraday is Avogadro's number of electrons and this reaction requires three moles, or 3F per mole of MnO_4^-. You want lg of MnO_2 (atomic wt. = 86.94 g / mole), which is (1g) / (86.94g / mole) or (.0115) moles of MnO_2 . Since one mole of MnO_2 will be produced for every mole of MnO_4^- , you must reduce .0115 moles of MnO_4^- . One faraday will reduce (1 / 3) of a mole of MnO_4^- . To reduce all of it, you want 3 Faraday's / mole. Thus, number of Faraday's required = (3F / mole)(.0115 mole) = .0345F . MnO_4^- + 8H^++ 7e^- \\rightarrow Mn + 4H_2O to occur. 7 electrons are to be transferred. Thus, 1 Faraday can only reduce (1 / 7) mole of material. However, you want 1 gram-equivalent of material, which is the amount deposited by 1F. Hence, 7 equiv. of Mn = 1 mole Mn. Thus, to deposit this amount, you use (1.00 equiv. Mn)(F / equiv.

{"question": "Live bacteria, all of which were red in color, were placed under an ultra-violet lamp. After several days, groups of white bacteria began to appear among the red. What conclusions, if any, can be made at this stage? What further experiments should be performed?", "solution": "At this stage, we can guess that the white bacteria probably arose as the result of a mutation. We know that exposure to ultraviolet radiation usually causes an increase in the mutation rate, i.e., it is said to induce mutations. We also know that the white bacteria arose from among the red, and in the same culture medium. If the original culture was indeed genetically pure (all the individuals having come from the same cell and thus having identical genotypes), there is no reason for any of the bacteria to exhibit different behavior or charac-teristics while remaining in the same environment. A change in phenotype could only be caused by a change in the genetic structure, in this case, a genetic mutation. In order to be absolutely sure that the change in color is indeed caused by a genetic mutation, we can test the permanence of the change. If there has been a change in genetic structure, it must necessarily be passed on to offspring of the cell with the original mutation. We can remove the white cells from the culture and grow them in a separate, identical medium. If they reproduce true- to-type, and produce a colony of only white bacteria, we can be sure that a mutation has indeed occurred. Of course there is always a possibility that back mutation will occur, with a reversion to red color, but this is very rare. It is important to note that while we know that UV radiation is a potential mutagen (agent inducing mutation), we cannot be entirely sure that all of the mutations resulted from UV rays. Some could have arisen as a result of a spontaneous change. Spontaneous muta-tions are chance occurrences, which are not caused by a specific external agent. The facts of the experiment, however, do fit well with what we know of the mechanisms of UV-induced mutations. Ultraviolet rays are theorized to affect the pyrimidines in DNA. They do this by (1) hydrolysing cytosine to a product that may cause mispairing, and (2) joining thymine molecules together to form dimers which block normal transcription from occur-ring. If such changes did occur, they would affect the production of substances that is coded for genetically. In this case, the gene product could have been a specific enzyme necessary for the production of red color. Its absence would account for the reversion to white color in the mutants. Of course an equally probable cause would be the production of an enzyme responsible for the whitecolor morphology in the mutants.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F24-0635.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The white bacteria probably arose as the result of a mutation."}

{"question": "In the figure, a block has been placed on an inclined plane and the slope angle \\texttheta of the plane has been adjusted until the block slides down the plane at constant speed, once it has been set in motion. Find the angle \\texttheta.", "solution": "The forces on the block are its weight w and the normal and frictional components of the force exerted by the plane. The angle \\texttheta of the inclined plane is adjusted until the block slides down the plane. Since motion exist, the friction friction force is f_k = \\mu_kN. Take axes perpendicular and parallel to the surface of the plane. Then, applying Newton's Second Law to the x and y components of the block's motion, we obtain (see figure) \\sumF_x = \\mu_kN - w sin \\texttheta = 0 \\sumF_y = N - w cos \\texttheta = 0 . where \\sumF_x and \\sumF_y are the x and y components of the net force on the block.

{"question": "Discuss the role of pheromones in chemical communication.", "solution": "In general, communication between organisms can be defined as actionon the part of one individual that alters the behavior of another individual. Communication need not necessarily be visual or auditory, nor mustit always be confined to the present. If it is chemical, it obviously has theability to span time. Specific chemicals involved in social communicationare called pheromones, by analogy with hormones. Pheromones are small quantities of specific chemical substances released byan organism which act upon another organism at a distance from their pointof release and in very specific ways. Pheromones can be classified in two groups: those that possess releasereffects, which elicit immediate behavioral responses, and those thathave primer effects, which work by altering the physiology and subsequentbehavior of the recipient. Releaser pheromones are used by a variety of animals for different purposes, such as the attraction of mates, individual recognition, or trail or territorialmarking. The females of many moth species secrete pheromonesto attract males over large areas. The area within which the substanceis dense enough to be detected by a male moth is called the activespace. When a sexually active male flies into the active space, it fliesupwind until it reaches the pheromone-emitting female. This particular pheromoneis very potent since only one molecule of it is needed to stimulatea receptor on the male's antennae. The sugarglider ,asquirrel- likemarsupial, uses its own glandular secretions to mark its territorial boundaries. Male sugar gliders also mark their mates with pheromone, for recognitionand in order to warn other males that their mate is claimed. Ants use pheromones to lay down a trail from a recent food source to their nest. The pheromone, which is laid from the tip of their stinger, evaporates toform an active space. This enables other ants to rapidly find the food source. Primer pheromones change the physiology of the recipient by activatingcertain endocrine glands to secrete hormones. These hormones subsequentlycause changes in the behavioral patterns of the recipient. For example, social insects such as ants, bees and termites use primer pheromonesin caste determination .In termites the king and queen secreteprimer pheromones which are ingested by workers, preventing themfrom developing reproductive capabilities. In mammals, the estrous cycleof female mice can be initiated by the odor of a male mouse. In addition, the odor of an unfamiliar male mouse can block the pregnancy of afemale that has been newly impregnated by another male. This enables thestrange mouse to mate with the female. However, if the olfactory bulbs ofthe female are removed, the pregnancy block will not occur. This signifiesthat pheromones, unlike hormones, have an external rather than internalsource.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F31-0795.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Pheromones are small quantities of specific chemical substances released by an organism which act upon another organism at a distance from their point of release and in very specific ways."}

We construct as a Gaussian surface, a rec-tangular box with one face within the top plate and another between the plates, as in the diagram (a). Since the plates are separated by a distance which is small compared to their length, the field between them is uniform. Therefore: \\intE^\\ding{217} \\bullet ds^\\ding{217} = q / \\epsilon_0 = \\sigmaA / \\epsilon_0, E = \\sigmaA /A\\epsilon0= \\sigma / \\epsilon_0 where A is the area of the face of the Gaussian surface between the plates. We see that since the vertical sides are parallel to the field, they make no contribution to the flux. The face within the top plate also makes no contribution to the flux since the field within a conductor is zero. Next, we must calculate the force on an infinitesimal charge element dq on the bottom plate. Part of the field between the plates is due to charge elements such as this one. Therefore, in order to obtain the net external field acting on dq (which we use to calculate the force on dq) we must subtract the field due to dq, from the field between the plates. We construct as a Gaussian surface a rectangular box (see figure (b)) with horizontal faces very close to the surface of dq. Close to dq, the field is vertical and uniform. This occurs because, at this distance, dq ap-pears to be a long sheet of charge. Since dq has an almost infinitesimal width, the flux through the vertical faces is negligible. By Gauss's law: \\intE^\\ding{217} \\bullet dS^\\ding{217} = 2dAE_1 = dq / \\epsilon_0 = \\sigmadA /\\epsilon_0, E_1 = \\sigma / 2\\epsilon_0 Thus, the net external field acting on dq is: E' = E \\rule{1em}{1pt} E_1 = (\\sigma / \\epsilon_0) \\rule{1em}{1pt} (\\sigma / 2\\epsilon_0) = (\\sigma / 2\\epsilon_0) The force on dq then is: dF = E'dq = (\\sigma / 2\\epsilon_0)dq Therefore the total force on a plate is F = \\intdF = \\surd(\\sigma / 2\\epsilon_0)dq = (\\sigma / 2\\epsilon_0)Q = [(Q/A ) / (2\\epsilon_0)]Q = q^2 / (2\\epsilon_0A) F = (10^\\rule{1em}{1pt}3 coul)^2 / [2(8.85 \u00d7 10^\\rule{1em}{1pt}12 farads/m)( 1m^2)] = (5.65 \u00d7 10^4 [coul^2/{( coul^2 \\rule{1em}{1pt}sec^2 / kg\\rule{1em}{1pt}m^2)\\rule{1em}{1pt}m}] = 5.65 \u00d7 10^4 (kg\\rule{1em}{1pt}m / sec^2) = 5.65 \u00d7 10^4 N", "images": ["images/D18-0608_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Physics/D18-0608.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Capacitance: 8.05 \u00d7 10^9 farads, Work done: 62.1 joules, Force: 5.65 \u00d7 10^4 N"}
{"question": "Explain how the codon for phenylalanine was discovered.", "solution": "It has been known for some time now that the genetic code is a triplet code - three bases in a messenger RNA molecule code for one amino acid. Each triplet is known as a codon and the entire set of codons comprising the RNA molecule constitute the genetic code for a polypeptide chain. The translation of the genetic code resulted from recent research the aim of which was to determine the exact sequence of the bases on the mRNA molecule which specifies a particular amino acid. An important breakthrough in this research came when a method of artificially synthesizing mRNA was developed. Ribose sugar, phosphate ions, and various bases, when combined under the proper conditions, result in the formation of a synthetic RNA molecule. By varying the kinds of bases used in producing this RNA, it has been possible to determine which base sequences result in which amino acids. The synthetic mRNA is placed with ribosomes, amino acids, ATP, and tRNA. The resulting polypeptide chain is analyzed for its component amino acids. The codon for the amino acid phenylalanine was the first to be discovered using the above procedure. The only base used in the synthesis of the mRNA, was uracil, and therefore the molecule had a series of UUU codons. This mRNA was added to ribosomes, amino acids, ATP and tRNA, and the resulting polypeptide consisted only of phenylalanine.

How high will the rocket be at 12:15 PM? (assuming a straight-line trajectory). Write a FORTRAN program to find the height at intervals of 0.5 minutes.", "solution": "Force may be expressed as the change of momentum, as given by Newton's second law: F =dp/dt. Now, we establish that positive y is the vertical direction upwards. If M_0 is the total mass of rocket and fuel before the launch, and m is the mass of the exiting fuel jet, then the rate of change in momentum is given by: F = (d/dt)(MV) + (V -V_e) (dm/dt) We must also take into account the force of gravity, which is acting against the motion of the rocket. The formula will not be derived step-by-step here; a text on differential equations will have the thorough explanation. However, all variables will be explained, after presenting the general equation. The initial condition v = 0 at t = 0 yields the equation: V = -gt-V_eln[(m_0 -ut) / u] then, by integrating, the equation of motion is obtained, which expresses the height y as a function of time t: y = -(1/2)gt2+V_e[t + {( m_0 -ut) / u} 1n {(m_0 -ut) / m_0}] The variables are as follows: y = vertical height; -(1/2)gt^2 = the effect of gravity pulling the rocket downward; hence the use of the negative sign. V_e= the exit velocity of the fuel jet M_0 = original mass of the rocket plus theunburaedfuel u = dm/dt= the rate of change of the mass of the unburned fuel Note that as the rocket rises, the mass of the fuel, and ultimately, the total mass of the rocket is decreasing. Also notice that in the program, a decision should be made upon appropriate values for M_0, \\mu ,V_e. It is assumed that these have already been read in.

{"question": "How are eyes formed in embryos of the bird and mammals?", "solution": "In the area of the forebrain, there appears a lateral growth on each side of the neural tube. These saclike protrusions are termed the optic vesicles. These vesicles grow outward and come into contact with the inner surface of the overlying epidermis. When contact is made, the optic vesicle flattens out and invaginates to form a double walled optic cup. The inner, much thicker layer of the cup ultimately will become the sensory retina of the eye, and the outer layer becomes the pigment layer of the retina. When the optic cup touches the overlying epidermis it stimulates the latter to develop into a lens rudiment. In birds and mammals, the epidermis thickens and folds in to produce a pocket. This pinches off and forms a lens vesicle that lies in the opening of the optic cup and is surrounded by the iris, formed from the rim of the optic cup. The cells on the inner side of the lens vesicle become columnar and then are transformed into long fibers. The nuclei degenerate and the cytoplasm becomes hard, transparent and able to refract light.", "images": ["images/F23-0601_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F23-0601.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Eyes are formed in embryos of the bird and mammals through the development of optic vesicles from the forebrain, which invaginate to form an optic cup.

Calculate the speed of the proton.", "solution": "The centripetal force acting on the proton causes it to curve.

{"question": "Suppose a fisherman was interested in trying to extract the maximum number of fish from a pond or lake. Why would it not be to his economic advantage to reduce the fish populations by excessive harvesting?", "solution": "The ideal economic strategy for the fisher- man to follow would be to catch only enough fish so as to keep the population at a level of optimal yield. If the population is allowed to reach the maximum that the environment can support, or if it is exploited to the point where the organisms become scarce, the yield will decline. This phenomenon exists because the greatest amount of increase in population size does not occur either when the population is very low or when the population has reached the carrying capacity of the environment. The point of greatest growth and hence the maximum replacement capacity of a population occurs at a point midway on the exponential part of an S-shaped growth curve, that is, half way between the baseline and the maximum carrying capacity (see figure). This point corresponds to the point of steepest rise on the S- shaped curve. At this point, the greatest number of new individuals are added to the population in a given amount of time. This maximum rate of population growth is referred to as the optimal yield. Fish populations, as well as other animal populations that man harvests, can be obtained with much less effort at a point of optimal yield than populations reduced by overfishing. Moreover, the greater the exploitation of populations, the more the population will come to consist of younger and smaller individuals, which are usually the least valuable commercially. The proportion of large fish caught is higher when the population is at a point of optimal yield. Consequently, as the fish populations are reduced, more expensive and sophisticated ships and trawling techniques are required to produce the same amount of yield.", "images": ["images/F30-0771_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F30-0771.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "Optimal yield"}
{"question": "The concentration of sodium ions (Na+) inside most cells is lowerthan the concentration outside the cells. Why can't this phenomenonbe explained by simple diffusion across the membraneand what process is responsible for this concentrationdifference?", "solution": "Since the cell membrane is somewhat permeable to sodium ions, simplediffusion would result in a net movement of sodium ions into the cell, until the concen-trations on the two sides of the membrane became equal. Sodium actually does diffuse into the cell rather freely, but as fast asit does so, the cell actively pumps it out again, against the concentrationdifference. The mechanism by which the cell pumps the sodium ions out is calledactive transport. Active transport requires the expenditure of energy forthe work done by the cell in moving molecules against a concentration gradient. Active transport enables a cell to maintain a lower concentration ofsodium inside the cell, and also enables a cell to accumulate certain nutrientsinside the cell at concentrations much higher than the extracellularconcentrations. The exact mechanism of active transport is not known. It has been proposedthat a carrier molecule is involved, which reacts chemically with themolecule that is to be ac-tively transported. This forms a compound whichis soluble in the lipid portion of the membrane and the carrier com- poundthen moves through the membrane against the concen-tration gradientto the other side. The transported molecule is then released, and thecarrier molecule diffuses back to the other side of the membrane whereit picks up another molecule. This process requires energy, since workmust be done in transporting the molecule against a diffusion gradient. The energy is supplied in the form of ATP. The carrier molecules are thought to be integral proteins; proteins whichspan the plasma membrane. These proteins are specific for the moleculesthey transport.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F02-0061.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Active transport"}
{"question": "What factors determine the characteristics ofparticular organismsthat exist in an ecosystem.", "solution": "Temperature and precipitation are among the most crucial physical factorsin determining what type of vegetation will exist in a certain area. It isoften possible to predict the type of biome at a given locality from the characteristicsof the climate. However, other physical factors are also important. The structure and chemistry of the soil can be equally vital. There are, for example, certain trace elements known to be essential for thefull development of plants. These include boron, chlorine, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, sodium, vanadium, and zinc. When one or more of these substances is not present in sufficient con-centration, land which should carry a forest according to the temperature- precipitation features, will instead be covered with shrubby vegetation, or be grassland bearing a few scattered trees. Where grasslandwas indicated, there may existsparcevegetation typical of a desert. Any single factor such as the amount of sun-light, temperature, humidity, or the concentration of trace elements is capable of determining thepresence or absence of species and thus the characteristics of the entirebiome. The Law of Minimum is a generalization that is sometimes usedto explain this phenomenon. It states that the factor that is most deficientis the one that determines the presence and absence of species. It does not matter, for example, how favorable temperature and sunlight arein a given locality, or how rich the nutrients and trace elements of the soilare if the precipitation is very low, because the result will still be a desert. Only a consideration of all the climatic and soil characteristics of a regioncan reveal the reasons for the existence of certain plant formations.

{"question": "The hydra has a unique nervous system. What is this type of system called? Explain how the system operates.", "solution": "The nervous system of the hydra is primitive. The nerve cells, arranged in an irregular fashion, are located beneath the epidermis and are particularly con-centrated around the mouth. There is no aggregation or coordination of nerve cells to form a brain or spinal cord as in higher animals. Because of the netlike ar-rangement of the nerve cells, the system is called a nerve net. For some time it was thought that these nerve cells lacked synapses, but at the present time research indicates that synapses are indeed present. (Synapse is the junction between the axon of one nerve cell, or neuron, and the dendrite of the next.) It is known that some synapses are symmetrical, that is, both the axon and thedendriticterminals secrete a transmitter substance and an impulse can be initiated in either direction across the synapse; while some are asymmetrical, permitting transmission only in one direction. Impulse in the nerve net can move in either direction along the fibers. The firing of the nerve net results primarily from the summation of impulses from the sensory cells involved, which pick up the external stimuli and the degree to which the response is local or general depends on the strength of the stimulus. When a sensory cell, or receptor, is stimulated, an impulse is relayed to a nerve cell. This in turn relays the impulse to other nerve cells, called effectors, which sti-mulate muscle fibers and nematocyst discharge. The rate of transmission of nerve impulses in hydra is usually quite slow. In spite of the fact that the nerve net is very primitive in comparison to the verte-brate type of nervous system, it is apparently adequate for hydra.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F11-0278.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The system is called a nerve net."}

{"question": "Describe the parts of a typical flower. What are their functions?", "solution": "The flower of an angiosperm is a modified stem on which concentric rings of modified leaves are attached. A typical flower consists of four such rings of structures borne on the receptacle, the expanded end of the flower stalk. The stalk of the flower is also known as the pedicel. The outermost ring, usually green and most like ordinary leaves, is composed of sepals. These enclose and protect the flower bud until it is ready to open. Collectively, the sepals are known as the calyx. Internal to the calyx are the petals, which are often brilliantly colored in order to attract those insects or birds which promote pollination. Flowers which are pollinated by the wind need not be attractive to birds and insects, and so their petals tend to be less showy, and may even be absent. Inside the corolla lie the stamens, the male reproductive organs of the flower. Each stamen consists of a slender stalk called the filament, which supports an expanded anther at the tip. The immature anther is composed primarily of pollen sacs. After reaching maturity, the anther contains numerous pollen grains, which produce haploid male gametes upon germination. In the center of the flower is a pistil (carpel) or pistils, the female reproductive organ. Each pistil is composed of a swollen portion, the ovary, at its base; a long, slender stalk which rises from the ovary, the style; and on top of this, an enlarged flattened crown called the stigma. The ovary contains one or more ovules, which are the future seeds of the angiosperm. The stigma's function is to secrete a moist, sticky substance to which the pollen grains will adhere. The style provides a lubricated pathway through which the pollen tube of the germinated pollen grain can grow on its way towards the egg cell.", "images": ["images/F08-0196_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F08-0196.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "A typical flower consists of four rings of structures: the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils.

{"question": "What is meant by a gene pool, balanced polymorphism, and genetic load?", "solution": "Population geneticists visualize a population of organisms as a collection of all the genes possessed by the individuals of the population. Such a sum total of genes is termed a gene pool. Each allele in the gene pool has a certain probability of being expressed in the population. The frequency of occurrence of a given genotype in the population is given by the product of the frequencies of its alleles in the gene pool. A gene pool is said to be in equilibrium if the frequency of each individual allele remains constant from generation to generation; that is to say, when there is no change in the genetic composition of the population over a period of time. The term polymorphism refers to the existence in the same interbreeding population of two or more distinct phenotypic forms of a genetically determined trait. The human blood groups 0, A, B, and AB are a classic example of polymorphism. Balanced polymorphism is a state in which the different forms of the polymorphic genotype are maintained together in equilibrium in the population over a period of time, Such a balance can be achieved and maintained through a variety of means, involving, what are often complex genetic-environmental interactions. One condition which produces balanced polymorphism is heterozygote superiority or heterosis. Here the heterozy-gote (Aa) has a survival advantage over both the dominant (AA) and recessive (aa) homozygotes. Thus both alleles are maintained in the population, and neither can eliminate the other. A classic example of this is sickle-cell anemia in a malarial environment. Contrary to what one might expect, the sickle-cell trait is maintained at a relatively high frequency in the population despite its obvious harmful effects. Individuals carrying the recessive sickle-cell gene in the heterozygous state have resistance to malarial infection. When both malaria and sickle-cell anemia are strong selection factors, the heterozygote has superiority, since normal homozygotes are subject to malaria and those homozygous for the sickle-cell gene have sickle-cell anemia. Thus the recessive gene is maintained along with the normal gene, and their traits are kept in balance. Often, a given species maintains different forms in the population because one or the other is favored at varying times in the year. The polymorphism gives the species an overall survival ability throughout the year. In geographic polymorphism, the species population may maintain a variety of forms, each of which is advantageous under specific environment conditions; one form may do better in one area, another in a different area. On the whole, the species is thus able to maintain itself in a variety of areas and environmental conditions, allowing it to become more widespread. Balanced polymorphism is important in evolution because it maintains a certain amount of variability in the population to permit further adaptive changes. However, although a certain amount of variability is advantageous, too great a genetic variety in the population can be harmful. Geneticists reason that different forms have differing effects upon the overall fitness of a population.

{"question": "What are the differences between the queenbee, the worker bee , and the drone?", "solution": "A honey bee colony consists of a single re-productive female, the queen , a few hundred males, called drones, and thousands of workers, which are sterile females. Drones hatch from unfertilized eggs, and are haploid , while females hatch from fertilized eggs, and are thus diploid. The type of food fed to the female larva determines whether it will develop into a worker or queen. A diet of \"royal jelly\" causes her to become a fertile queen . The work performed by a worker bee is determined by its age. For two weeks after metamorphosis, workers function as nurse bees, first incubating the brood and preparing brood cells, later feeding the larvae. Then the sterile females become house bees for one or two weeks, working as storekeepers, waxsecreters, or guards and cleaning the hive, or ventilating it by fanning their wings. The worker finally becomes a food gatherer for four or five .weeks, and collects nectar, pollen, and water. A queen bee soon after hatching mates several times with male drone bees. The queen accumulates enough sperm to last for her lifetime, and stores the sperm in-ternally in aspermatotheca. Thereafter shelays fertilized and unfertilized eggs, as many as a thousand a day. The drone dies after copulation; its reproductive organs literally explode into the female . When the number of bees in a hive becomes too large, about half the drones and workers, a new queen bee, and the old queen bee migrate to a new location and begin a new society. The old colony is left with developing queens.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F12-0317.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "A honey bee colony consists of a single re-productive female, the queen , a few hundred males, called drones, and thousands of workers, which are sterile females.

{"question": "(a) With what speed must a ball be thrown directly upward so that it remains in the air for 10 seconds? (b) What will be its speed when it hits the ground? (c) How high does the ball rise?", "solution": "Near the surface of the earth, all objects fall towards its center with a constant acceleration g = 32 ft/sec^2. Therefore, when the ball is thrown, its speed must decrease by 32 ft/sec each second until it reaches 'its maximum height. Then it starts to fall, gaining speed at the rate of 32 ft/sec^2, and retraces its path, hitting the ground with the same speed at which it started the trip upward. This is so because the acceleration is constant and the distance traveled is the same during the rising and falling portions of the motion of the ball. Thus, the average velocity must have the same magnitude in each case and the time required to reach the maximum height must equal the time required to fall back to the ground. (a) Let the upward direction be positive. Then v_0 is positive and the acceleration a is negative. After 10 seconds, v must equal -v_0. From the kinematics equation v = v_0 + at we have for the instant before it hits the ground, -v_0 = v_0 -gt -2v_0 = -gt andv_0 =gt/2 = [(32 ft/sec^2)(10 sec)]/2 = 160 ft/sec (b) The speed of the ball when it hits the ground is -v_0 or - 160 ft/sec. (c) The height reached by the ball can be obtained by realizing that the rise of the ball must take half the total time the ball is in the air, or 5 seconds. The average velocity for this part of the motion must be v = (v-_i +v_f_-)/2 = {(160 ft/sec) + (0 ft/sec)} /2 = 80 ft/sec. The height the ball rises is then d =vt= (80 ft/sec)(5 sec) = 400 ft. This result can also be obtained using the kinematics equation d = v_0t + (1/2) at^2 Substituting values, d = (160 ft/sec)(5 sec) + (1/2) (-32 ft/sec^2)(5 sec)^2 = 800 ft - 400 ft = 400 ft.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Physics/D03-0082.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "(a) 160 ft/sec, (b) - 160 ft/sec, (c) 400 ft"}
{"question": "What is the role of transpiration in plants? Describe the mechanism of transpiration.", "solution": "The leaves of a plant exposed to the air will lose moisture by evaporation unless the air is saturated with water vapor. This loss of water by evaporation, mainly from the leaves (but also from the stems) is called transpiration. Transpiration plays a very important role in water transport in plants. It directs the upward movement of water and minerals from the soil to the leaves, keeps the air spaces of leaves moist for carbon dioxide to dissolve in, concentrates initially dilute leaf cell solutions of minerals that have been absorbed by the roots, and contributes to the cooling of the plant body by removing heat during the vaporization of water (540 calories of heat are needed to convert each gram of water to water vapor). Transpiration is responsible for the great amount of water that passes through a plant body per day. About 98 per cent of the water absorbed by the roots is lost as vapor. As water is lost by evaporation from the surface of amesophyllcell, the concentration of solutes in the cell sap increases, causing water to pass into it from neighboring cells that contain more water, that is, lower solute concentration. These neighboring cells in turn receive water from thetracheidsand vessels of the leaf veins, which ultimately obtain water from the soil via root hair cells. Thus, during transpiration, water passes from the soil via the xylem system of the roots, stem, and leaf veins, and through the intervening cells, to themesophylland finally into air spaces in the leaves, where most of it vaporizes and escapes.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F10-0256.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Transpiration directs the upward movement of water and minerals from the soil to the leaves, keeps the air spaces of leaves moist for carbon dioxide to dissolve in, concentrates initially dilute leaf cell solutions of minerals that have been absorbed by the roots, and contributes to the cooling of the plant body by removing heat during the vaporization of water."}

{"question": "It is easy to understand how selfish behavior can be explained by natural selection. But how can one account for altruism?", "solution": "Selfish behavior is exemplified in the formation of dominance hierarchies. The high-ranking animals eat before the other animals when food is scarce and take preference in the selection of mates and resting places. Consequently, these individuals are generally healthier, live longer and reproduce more frequently. Natural selection favors these strong animals, in that they produce more offspring having their superior traits. Selfish behavior is expected to be transferred to future generations since it leads to the more successful survival of the animal. Altruism is self-sacrificial behavior that benefits other members in a group. An altruistic animal reduces its own fitness, and therefore its chances of survival and reproduction, in order to increase the success of another animal or of the group as a whole. For example, a male baboon remains to fight a leopard while the troop escapes. Natural selection would not favor the continuation of this costly behavior since those who do show it are less likely to survive and reproduce. One would therefore expect the genes for altruism to be lost, but they are not. The reason for this lies in the fact that the male baboon - only risks its life for baboons in his own troop, not for baboons in other troops. His behavior therefore benefits only those baboons related to itself; these baboons probably share common genes, among which are those for altruistic behavior. The al-truistic behavior thus preserves the genes in the other members that are shared with the altruistic member by common descent. For the altruistic genes to be favored in natural selection, the benefit that the related members receive must outweigh the loss of the altruistic animal. Although the baboon might die and lose its ability to pass on its genes, the baboon's brother can compensate for the loss. To do so, it must have more than twice as many offspring as a result of its brother's altruistic behavior. (Since about 1/2 of the genes of a given animal are shared by its brother or sister.) Similarly, since first cousins share 1/4 of their genes, on the average, compensation would involve quadrupling the survivor's offspring. Altruism directed at a variety of relatives, from offspring to cousins, results in a summation of the benefits so that the altruistic gene(s) may be preserved and the related behavior may evolve. Thus, the existence of altruism can be accounted for by natural selection. To demonstrate the compensation by a relative for the loss of an altruistic relative, we will assume that altruism is determined by one allele, A. If one offspring of F_1 generation dies, its brother can compensate by doubling its offspring, (F_2). This will double the frequency of A in F_2 (2 \u00d7 1/4) to give 1/2, the frequency that A would have had in F_1 if the brother had not died. Similarly, if one altruistic offspring in the F_2 generation dies, its cousin (also in F_2) can compensate by quadrupling its offspring, F_3. Four times the frequency of A in F_3 (4 \u00d7 1/8) gives 1/2, which would be the frequency of A in F_1 if the cousin had not died. It is important to note that compensation must always be referred back to the F_1 generation, since that is the only way to prevent a loss of the altruistic gene.", "images": ["images/F31-0821_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F31-0821.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Altruism can be accounted for by natural selection as the altruistic behavior preserves the genes in the other members that are shared with the altruistic member by common descent."}

It consists mainly of SO_2 but may contain anywhere from 1 to 10% SO_3 computed as percent by weight of the total mass. What would be the approximate range to assign to x?", "solution": "One finds x by determining the number of 0 atoms present for each S present. For purposes of calcula-tion assume that one always has 100 g of the mixture of S0_2 and SO_3. Thus when 1% of the mixture is SO_3, there will be 1 g of SO_3 present and 99 g of SO_2 present. One then finds the number of moles present of each element. The ratio of S : 0 is then determined. Solving for x when 1% of the mixture is SO_3: (MW of SO_2 = 64, MW of SO_3 = 80). The number of moles present is equal to the number of grams present divided by the molecular weight. For SO_3 : (1g)/(80 g/mole) = 1.25 \u00d7 10^-2 moles For SO_2 : (99 g)/(64 g/mole) = 1.55 moles. Because there is one S present in each compound the total amount of S is 1.55 moles + 1.25 \u00d7 10^-2 moles or 1.56 moles.

{"question": "Discuss the etiology, epidemiology and prophylaxis of tuberculosis .", "solution": "It is first necessary to define the terms used in the question before one can answer it. Etiology refers to the cause of a disease. Epidemiology deals with the cause and control of epidemics. An epidemic is the unusual prevalence or sudden appearance of a disease in a community. Prophylaxis is the preventive treatment used to protect against disease. Many of the important infections of man are air-borne and cause diseases of the respiratory tract. Tuberculosis is an endemic respiratory disease ; it is peculiar to a locality or a people. Although evidence of itsexistence has been found in Egyptian mummies 3000 years old, it is still a leadingcause of death. In the nineteenth century, Robert Koch isolated the causative agent of human tuberculosis -Mycobacteriumtuberculosis. Koch proved that pure cultures of these bacilli would produce the infection in experimental animals, and he later recovered the bacilli form these animals . There are several types of tubercle bacilli (the common name): the human, bovine, avian and other varieties. One strain is almost exclusively a human parasite, and is responsible for over ninety percent of all cases of tuberculosis. The less common bovine strain can cause tuberculosis in man through ingestion of in-fected beef or milk from an infected cow. It is characteristic of tuberculosis and other res-piratory diseases to occur in epidemic form, attacking many people within a short time. Their incidence usually increases during fall and winter, when many people frequently remain indoors. The tubercle bacillus is transmitted by association with infected people through the secretions of the nose and throat, which is spread in droplets by coughing and sneezing. It may be transmitted by articles which have been used by an infected person, such as eating and drink-ing utensils and handkerchiefs. The lungs are the most commonly affected tissue , often exhibiting tubercles or small nodules. These are areas of destroyed lung tissue in which the tubercle bacilli grow. Symptoms of tuber-culosis include pleurisy (inflamationof the pleural mem-brane which line the chest and cover the lungs), chest pains, coughing, fatigue and loss of weight. Treatment consists of bed rest, nourishing diet, and sometimes chemotherapy. The most effective drug, INH (isonicotinicacid hydrazide ) is used both for chemotherapy andchemopropylaxis. For actual prevention, the drug is administered before infection to highly susceptible individuals. High death rates in developing countries are due to substandard housing , overcrowding, and malnutrition. Prophylaxis for a community is best achieved when living and working conditions are not overcrowded, diet is ade-quate, and proper sanitation is available.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F05-0159.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Tuberculosis is an endemic respiratory disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

{"question": "What function does oxygen serve in the body?", "solution": "Oxygen is necessary for the process of cellular respiration. This process involves the catabolism of glucose to result in the production of energy, in the form of ATP, for utilization by the cell. Cellular respiration can be thought to have two parts. The first series of reactions can take place without the presence of oxygen, while the second series of re-actions is dependent on oxygen. In the second reaction sequence, oxygen acts as the final hydrogen acceptor. This occurs in the electron transport system within the mitochondria. The oxygen combines with hydrogen, and is converted to a molecule of water. If anaerobic con-ditions existed (absence of oxygen), no ATP formation will occur in the mitochondria. It should be noted however that two ATP per glucose oxidized are still produced by the first series of reactions, collectively called glycolysis. Glycolysis will occur regardless of the availability of oxygen, and is restricted to the cytoplasm; it does not occur in the mitochondria. The amount of ATP produced via glycolysis is very small com-pared to that produced by the second reaction sequence. The second reaction sequence, which occurs only in the mitochondria, is collectively referred to as oxidative phosphorylation. Since the mitochondria provide about 95% of all the ATP formed in the cell, the absence of oxygen results in less energy production. This energy is required to maintain cell structure and function, and the cell will ultimately die without it.

Due to the symmetry of the loop, the vertical components of the dB^\\ding{217} contributions by all the elements of current carrying wire dl^\\ding{217}, cancel. The horizontal components add, however (see figure B). The magnitude of dB is dB = (\\mu_0 /4\\pi) [(I dlr sin \\alpha)/(r^3)] where \\alpha is the angle between dl^\\ding{217} and r^\\ding{217}.

What temperature must be assigned to the molecules in interplanetary space for this to be true?", "solution": "To solve this problem, one assumes that interplanetary space is an ideal gas at a low concentration and at a very low pressure. This means that the ideal gas law can be used, i.e., PV = n RT The pressure, P, is known 10^-16torr= 10^--16torrx (1atm/760torr) = 1.32 \u00d7 10^-19atmand R, the gas constant = 0.082atm-liter/mole-\\textdegreeK, is also known. The volume, V, and the number of moles, n, are unknown, but if n is divided by V, then this value becomes a density (moles/liter) and can be determined from the given density of 4 molecules/cm. To do this, (1) convert the number of molecules to moles using Avogadro's number and (2) convert cm^3 to units of l using the conversion 1 cm^3 = 1ml= 0.001l Thus, the density is [(4 molecules)/(1cm^3)] [{1000 cm^3/l} / {6.02 \u00d7 10^23 (molecules/mole)}] = 6.64 \u00d7 10^-21 moles/l Rearranging the ideal gas low from PV = n RT to P/R \\bullet V/n = T, andsubstituting the know values, yields T = [{1.32 \u00d7 10^-19atm} / {(0.082 (atm-liter/\\textdegreeK-mole)}] \u00d7 [1 / 6.64 \u00d7 10^-21(moles/l)] = 2.42 \u00d7 10^2 \\textdegreeK T = 242\\textdegreeK = 242\\textdegreeK - 273\\textdegree = - 31\\textdegreeC.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E25-0862.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "- 31\textdegreeC"}

If not, explain what happens, and deduce for what values of the re-fractive index of the material the ray actually emerges.", "solution": "Since the ray strikes the prism at grazing incidence, the refracted ray DE must enter at the critical angle \\textphi_C. Now angles DAE, ADF, and AEF are all right angles. This follows because the prism is right-angled, and also since DF and FE are normals to the surfaces BA and AC.

{"question": "Simultaneous removal of all nerves to the heart causes the heart rate to increase to about 100 beats per minute. What does this tell us about the regulation of the heart rate? Hormones regulate many bodily functions. Do they influence heart rate?", "solution": "The excitatory impulses of thesino-atrialnode occur spontaneously without the presence of nervous stimulation or hormones. But the S-A node is always under the influence of both nerves and hormones. Nervous control of the heart rate is found in the vasomotor center in the medulla oblongata of the brain. A large number of sympathetic nerve fibers run from this center to thesino-atrialnode. Sympathetic nerve stimulation increases the heart rate. The parasympathetic nerve fibers which innervate the heart are contained in thevagusnerve, which also runs from the medulla to the S-A node. Stimulation of thevagusnerve has the opposite effect of decreasing the heart rate, and if strong enough, may stop the heart completely. Cut-ting the sympathetic nerves decreases the heart rate, while cut-ting the parasympatheticvagusnerve increases the heart rate. Cutting or removing all nerves from the S-A node causes the heart rate to increase from its normal 70 beats per minute to 100b.p.m. This tells us two things: (1) that the heart rate is influenced by the nervous system; and (2) that the parasympathetic influence is stronger, since cutting both sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers increases the heart rate. This increased rate of 100b.p.m. is the inherent autonomous discharge rate of the S-A node (i.e., without any external influencing factors). There are sensory receptors in the walls of the right atrium superior and inferior vena cava which are stimulated when these walls are stretched by an increased volume of blood. The stimulated recep-tors send impulses to the vasomotor center in the brain which stimulates the sympathetic nerves; this increases the heart rate and stroke volume to compensate for the increased volume of blood in these areas of the heart. In addition, there are sensory receptors in the walls of the aorta and carotid arteries. These receptors are also stimulated by distension of the vessel walls and send impulses to the vasomotor center. Here, however, thevagusnerve is stimulated and the heart rate decreases. The nervous system adjusts the heart rate quickly to the metabolic needs of the body (such as during exercise). It also provides a feedback control to prevent any excessive cardiac response. Sympathetic stimulation acts via the neurotransmitternorepinephrine, while parasympathetic stimulation acts via the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Besides nervous control, the heart rate is also under hormonal control. Epinephrine, a hormone secreted by the adrenal medulla, is produced in increased amounts during emergencies or \"fight-or- flight\" situations. Epinephrine causes vasoconstriction in some vascular beds of the body (smooth muscle of the digestive tract) andvasodilationin both skeletal and cardiac muscle. Overall, it causes an increase in blood pressure and an increase in heart rate.Thyroxinealso increases the heart rate but it requires several hours to cause the acceleration. This hormone from the thyroid gland can only affect long-term responses of the heart, unlike the quick action of epinephrine.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F15-0380.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The heart rate is influenced by the nervous system and hormones.

This instruction is in octal. Writing it out in binary, we get 001001101010. The first bit on the left hand side is bit #0. The right--most bit is bit #11. Bit #4 is 0. This means the ad-dress is on Page 0. Hence, the last 7 bits give the address = 152. Bit #5 is also 0. This means that it is direct ad-dressing Hence, location 152 contains the operand. Thus, the AC gets the value of location 152, which is 1050. b) The instruction is 1352, in octal. Hence, in bi-nary the instruction is:001011101010. Bit #4 is 1. This means that the address is on the same page as the in-struction. But, the instruction is in location 400, i.e., on Page 2. Hence, the address is also on Page 2. Hence, the address is given by the first five bits of the PC concatenated with the last seven bits of the instruction. The program counter contains 0400, i.e., 000100000000. And, the instruction is: 001011101010. Hence, the add-ress is 000101101010, i.e., 0552. Now, the contents of location 552 are 320. Therefore 320 gets stored in the AC. c) The instruction 1552 means: 001 101 101 010. Bit #4 is 0, therefore address is on Page 0. Thus, the ad-dress is: 00000 1101 010 = 000 001 101 010 = 0 152 And, the Bit #3 is 1. This means it is Indirect Addressing. Hence, the location 0152 on Page 0 contains not the operand itself, but another address where the operand can be found. The content 1050 of location 152 is therefore an add-ress. And hence, the content of location 1050, viz., 5 is the operand which goes to the AC. Therefore it indicates the same page as the instruction at 400, i.e., at 000 100000000. Hence, the address is: 000101101010 = 000 101 101 010 = 0552. Now, the #3 bit is 1. Therefore it means indirect address-ing, and the content of 552 is an address of the op-erand. The content of 552 is: 320. Hence, 320 is the address of the operand. Now, the content of 320 is 3620. Hence, 3620 is the operand which goes to the AC.

Work is defined as the product of the pressure (P) and the change in volume (\u2206V) of a system, where only pressure-volume work is done. Much of the experimentation done by chemists is pressure-volume work because the work is usually done in an open container in the laboratory. The pressure, in this case, is constant and the volume of the materials is allowed to change. \u2206H = \u2206E + P\u2206V In this problem, one is given \u2206E but not P or \u2206V, so that one must calculate P\u2206V in some other way. The Ideal gas Law is defined as: P\u2206V = \u2206nRT, where P is the pressure, \u2206V is the change in volume, \u2206n is the change in the number of moles reacting, R is the gas constant (1.99 cal/mole-\\textdegreeK), and T is the absolute tem-perature. Here, one knows R and can calculate T and \u2206n. Therefore, \u2206nRTcan be substituted for P\u2206V in the equation to find \u2206H. \u2206n is found by subtracting the number of moles reacting from the number of moles formed as products. Here, 1 mole of CO and 0.5 mole of O_2 form 1 mole of CO_2. \u2206n = 1 mole CO_2 - (1 mole CO + 0.5 mole O_2) = - 0.5 mole.

In general, if a solid, A, dissociates into ions B,C,D,... according to the equation A \\rightarrow bB + cC + dD + ... , the ion product constant (I.P.) is given by I.P. = [B]^b [C]^c [D]^d ... . At the point where addition of solid will result in precipitation, the ion product constant is equal to the solubility product constant. (When I.P. > K_sp , precipitation will occur.)

{"question": "A diver descends to a depth of 15.0 m in pure water (density 1.00 g/cm^3). The barometric pressure is 1.02 standard atmospheres. What is the total pressure on the diver, expressed in atmospheres? (b) If, at the same barometric pressure, the water were the Dead Sea (1.20 g/cm^3), what would the total pressure be?", "solution": "Pressure is defined as force per unit area. Atmospheric is measured by using a barometer (usually a mercury barometer; see figure). It is constructed by inverting a tube longer than 76 cm filled with mercury into a dish of mercury. The atmosphere will support only that height of mercury which exerts an equivalent pressure; any excess mercury will fall into the reservoir and leave a space with zero air pressure above it. The pressure exerted on the diver from above is equal to the sum of the pressure exerted by the sea water and the pressure exerted by the atmosphere. One standard atmosphere equals the pressure exerted by exactly 76 cm (= exactly 760 mm) of mercury at 0\\textdegreeC (density Hg = 13.5951 g/cm^3) and at standard gravity, 980.665 cm/s^2. Thus, 1 standard atm equals 13.5951 g/cm^3 \u00d7 76 cm (exactly) \u00d7 980.665 cm/s^2 = 1.01325 \u00d7 10^6 dynes/cm^2.

However, the problem states that atmospheric press-ure is 1.02 standard atmospheres and, therefore, equals (1.02) (1.01325 x 10^6 dynes/cm^2) = 1.03 \u00d7 10^6 dynes/cm^2. To this atmospheric pressure, the pressure of the water is added to yield a total pressure of (1.03 \u00d7 10^6 dynes/cm^2) + (1.47 \u00d7 10^6 dynes/cm^2) = 2.50 \u00d7 10^6 dynes/cm^2.

The total pressure exerted is the pressure of the water plus the pressure of the atmosphere. The pressure of the atmosphere from part (a) is 1.03 \u00d7 10^6 dynes/cm^2. The pressure of the water must be calculated: pressure of water = density \u00d7 height \u00d7 standard gravity = 1.20 g/cm^3 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^3 cm \u00d7 980.665 cm/s^2 = 1.77 \u00d7 10^6 dynes/cm^2.

{"question": "Distinguish between active and passive immunity. How are they produced? Are vaccines andtoxoidsused to induce active immunity or passive immunity?", "solution": "Immunity is a natural or acquired resistance to a specific disease. A host is immune to a certain pathogen as long as the antibodies specific for the pathogen are present in his circulatory system. The crucial difference between active and passive immunity lies in the answer to the host's question, \"Are these anti-bodies made by me or were they formed in some other organism?\" Active immunity results when antibodies are produced by the cells (lymphocytes) of the host as a result of contact with an antigen. The antigen may be a microorganism or its product. Active immunity usually develops slowly within a couple of weeks (as antibody production reaches a maximum level), yet it may last up to many years for some antigens. Active immunity may be induced naturally, while recovering from an infectious disease such as mumps, measles, or chicken pox; or artificially, by vaccines. Vaccines are inactivated or attenuated microorganisms which can still stimulate antibody production. Attenuated microorganisms are living, yet too weak to be virulent. Vaccines are available for typhoid fever, poliomyelitis, rabies, smallpox and various other diseases. Also used to induce active immunity aretoxoids, made by destroying thepoisonous poisonous parts of the toxins produced by some pathogens. The antigenic part of the The antigenic part of the toxin is not affected and can still induce antibody production for protection against diphtheria, tetanus and other diseases. Passive immunity is conferred when antibodies produced by active immunity in one organism are transferred to another. Since no antigen is introduced, there is no stimulation of antibody production; hence, passive immunity is of short duration. It does provide immediate protection, unlike active immunity which requires time for development. Passive immunity is also conferred by both natural or arti-ficial means: naturally, by antibody transfer to the fetus from an immune mother (that is, by placental transfer), or artificially, by injection of serum containing antibodies from an immune individual to a susceptible one. In the latter case, it is not necessary that the donor and the recipient be of the same species. It is, however, dangerous for people who are allergic to animal serum, and so must be used with caution.

{"question": "What mutually beneficial adaptations have arisen in the flowering plants and certain insects?", "solution": "In the terrestrial environment, insects are of great ecological significance. Insects are crucial for the fertilization of many different species of angiosperms, the flowering plants. Approximately two-thirds of all angiosperms depend upon insects for pollination. Bees, wasps, butterflies, moths and flies are the principal insect pollinators. The three orders represented by these insects have an evolutionary history closely tied to that of flowering plants: both groups underwent an explosive period of development in the Cretaceous period, and both have evolved mechanisms or structures which promote insect pollination. Many insects rely on the nectar produced by plants for food. As the insect sucks up the nectar, the sticky pollen grains adhere to its feet and body. When the insect flies to another plant, the pollen grains stick to the new flower and fertilize the egg. A tremendous amount of adaptation between the flower-ing plants and the insects has occurred. The color, odor, and nectar of flowers all serve to attract insects. As an example, bees are attracted by bright blue arid yellow colors, and by sweet, aromatic, or minty odors. The flowers pollinated by bees have these characteristics, and often have a protruding lip on which the bee can land. Flowers pollinated by the wind, on the other hand, usually lack conspicuous colors, odors, and nectar, and the pollen is light, not sticky. The mouthparts of different insects also show advanced specialization. For example, butter-flies and moths suck liquid nectar, and have mouthparts modified to form a long tube. Bees, which gather both nectar and pollen for food, have mouthparts which are adapted for both sucking and chewing. A truly interesting adaptation for insect pollination is shown in some flowers with floral parts which evolved to resemble female insects of a species. The male insects are attracted to these flowers. The pollen grains are transferred to the bodies of the insects as they attempt to copulate with the insect- resembling flowers. Thus insects help to insure cross-pollination of species of flowers. Some insects eat the fruits of angiosperms and eliminate theundigestible seeds in their waste.

{"question": "Calculate the hydrolysis constants of the ammonium and cyanide ions, assuming K_W = 1 \u00d7 10^-14 and K_a = 4.93 \u00d7 10^-10 for HCN and K_b = 1.77 \u00d7 10^-5 for NH_3. For each, determine the percent hydrolysis in a .1M solution.", "solution": "To find the hydrolysis constant, you must know what it defines. Hydrolysis is the process whereby an acid or base is regenerated from its salt by the action of water. The hydrolysis constant measures the extent of this process. Quantitatively, it is defined as being equal to [K_W/(K_a or K_b)] , where K_W = the equilibrium constant for theautodissociationof water, K_a = dissociation of acid, and K_b = dissociation of base. You are givenK_w, K_a and K_b. Thus, the hydrolysis constants can be easily found by substitution. LetK_h= hydrolysis constant. For cyanide ion:K_h= (K_W/K_a) = [(1 \u00d7 10^-14)/(4.93 \u00d7 10^-10)] = 2.02 \u00d7 10^-5 For ammonium ion:K_h= (K_W/K_b) = [(1 \u00d7 10^-14)/(1.77 \u00d7 10^-5)] = 5.64 \u00d7 10^-10 To find the percent hydrolysis in a .1M solution, write the hydrolysis reaction and express the hydrolysis constant just calculated in those terms. After this, represent the concentrations of the hydrolysis products in terms of variables and solve. For cyanide ion: The hydrolysis reaction is CN^- + H_2O \\rightleftarrows HCN + OH^-. Therefore, K_h= {[HCN][OH^-]}/[CN^-]. But you calculated thatK_h= 2.02 \u00d7 10^-5 . Equating, 2.02 \u00d7 10^-5 = {[HCN][OH^-]}/[CN^-]. You start with a .1M solution of CN^-. Let x = [HCN] formed. Thus, x = [OH^- ] also, since they are formed inequimolaramounts. If x moles/liter of substance are formed from CN^-, then, at equilibrium you have .1 - x moles/liter left. Substituting these values, 2.02 \u00d7 10^-5 = [(x \\textbullet x)/(1 - x)] Solving, x = 1.4 \u00d7 10^-3M. The percent is just 100 times (x/.10M) since the initial concentration is .10M, so that you have 1.4% hydrolysis in a .1M solution. For ammonium ion: The hydrolysis reaction is NH_4^+ + H_2O \\rightleftarrows NH_3 + H_3O^+. K_hfor this reaction = {[NH_3][H_3O^+]}/[NH_4^+]. The calculatedK_h= 5.6 \u00d7 10^-10. Equating, 5.6 \u00d7 10^-10 = {[NH_3][H_3O^+]}/[NH_4^+]. From this point, you follow the same reasoning as was used with the cyanide. Solving: Let x = [NH_3] 5.6 \u00d7 10^-10 = [{(x) (x)}/(.1 - x)] x^2 = (5.6 \u00d7 10^-11) - (5.6 \u00d7 10^-10)x x^2 + (5.6 \u00d7 10^-10)x - 5.6 \u00d7 10^-11 = 0 Using the quadratic formula one can solve for x, where ax^2 +bx+ c = 0 x = [{- b\\pm \\surd(b^2 - 4 ac)}/2a] x = ([-5.6 \u00d7 10^-10 \\pm \\surd{(5.6 \u00d7 10^-10)^2 - 4(1)(-5.6 \u00d7 10^-11)}] / {2 (1)}) x = [{-5.6 \u00d7 10^-10 \\pm \\surd(2.24 \u00d7 10^-10)} / (2)] x = [(-5.6 \u00d710^-10 \\pm 1.50 \u00d7 10^-5) / (2)] x = [(1.50 \u00d7 10^-5)/2] or x = [(1.50 \u00d7 10^-5)/2] x cannot be negative, because concentration cannot be negative. Thus, x = 7.5 \u00d7 10^-6 Solving for the percent: [(7.5 \u00d7 10^-6)/(.1)] \u00d7 100% = 7.5% Thus, you find that the percent hydrolysis is 7.5 \u00d7 10-3%.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E10-0361.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The hydrolysis constants for cyanide ion is 2.02 \u00d7 10^-5 and for ammonium ion is 5.64 \u00d7 10^-10.

{"question": "Find the pH of 0.15 M H_2SO_4, solution, assuming K_2 =1.26 \u00d7 10^-2.", "solution": "Begin this problem by noting that pH = - log [H^+]. Thus, to find pH, calculate the [H^+] in 0.15 M H_2SO_4. H_2SO_4 is an acid and dissociates into H^+ (= H_3O^+) ions. The general reaction for acid dissociation can be written as HA + H_2O \\rightleftarrows H_3O^+ + A^-. H_2SO_4 undergoes this reaction, as H_2SO_4 + H_2O \\rightleftarrows H_3O^+ + HSO_4^-. But note, HSO_4^- is also an acid, it still possesses a hydrogen that can dissociate. Thus, one also has HSO_4^- + H_2O \\rightleftarrows H_3O^+ + SO_4^-. In other words, there exist two dissociation reactions. As given, the dissociation constant for the second reaction, K_2, measures the ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants. It is from this expression that [H^+] can be determined. H_2SO_4 is a very strong acid in its first dissociation reaction. This means it is completely ionized; i.e. 100% of the H^+ comes off (the first H^+ only). Thus, if there are 0.15 M of H_2SO_4, then, there are also 0.15 = [H^+] for the first dissociation. [H^+] = [HSO_4^-], as can be seen from the first dissociation reaction and are formed inequimolaramounts. Also, [HSO_4^-] = 0.15 (initially). For the second ionization, one is given K_2 = 1.26 \u00d7 10^-2, indicating dissociation is not complete. From the prior explanation of what K_2 indicates, one can write K_2 = 1.26 \u00d7 10^-2 = {[H_3O^+] [SO_4-]} / [HSO_4^-]. Note: Water is not included since it is assumed to be a constant. From the first dissociation, it is known that [H_3O^+] = 0.15. If x moles/liter of H^+ is produced in the second dissociation, the total [H_3O^+] = 0.15 + x. [SO_4 =] = [H_3O^+] from the second dissociation, since here they are formed in equimolar amounts. Thus, [SO_4-] = x. If one started with [HSO_4^-] = 0.15M (from the first dissociation) and x moles/liter dissociate in the second, one has [HSO_4^-] = 0.15 - x left. Substituting these values, 1.26 \u00d7 10^-2 = {[H_3O^+] [SO_4-]} / [HSO_4^-] = {(0.15 + x) (x)} / (0.15 - x) Solving for x (using the quadratic formula), x = .011.

{"question": "What is the change in entropy of a gas if the temperature increases from 100\\textdegreeK to 101\\textdegreeK when heat is added and the volume is kept constant?", "solution": "Consider a system containing a large number of particles. When heat is added to this system, the average kinetic energy of the particles will increase. This is reflected as an increase in the temp-erature of the system. The system will have a higher internal disorder as a result of increased thermal motion of its constituents. The entropy of a system is a measure of the tendency of a system to increase its internal disorder. Therefore, as heat is added, entropy increases. In our problem, let the increase in entropy be \u2206s when the system reaches a new equilibrium after its temperature increases by \u2206T = 1\\textdegreeK Since \u2206T << T = 100\\textdegreeK, the amount of the heat added must be very small, and the entropy change is \u2206s = Q/T where Q is the quantity of heat added. The heat added to a gas is equal to the gas' increase in internal energy plus the work done on the gas while expanding. The volume is kept constant, therefore the mechanical work done is zero .

{"question": "In humans, the liver is one of the largest and most active organsin the body. Describe its functions.", "solution": "One of the most important functions of the liver is to regulate the levelof glucose in the blood stream. The maintenance of a constant level ofblood glucose is essential because specialized cells, such as the brain cells, are easily damaged by slight fluctuations in glucose levels. Excess glucoseis stored in the liver as glycogen while declining blood glucose canbe restored by conversion of liver glycogen into glucose. In addition to theformation of glycogen, the liver can convert glucose into fat, which is theneither stored in the liver itself or in special fat-deposit tissues known asadipose tissues. The production of bile occurs in the liver. Bile is of major importancein aiding the digestion of fats. It is secreted by the liver cells intoa number of small ducts which drain into a common bile duct. Bile is storedin the gallbladder, which releases its contents upon stimulation by thepresence of fats in the duodenum. When proteins are metabolized, ammonia, a toxic sub-stance, is formed. The cells of the liver are able to detoxify ammonia rapidly by transformingit into the relatively inert substance urea. Urea can then be excretedfrom the body in the urine. The liver also produces a lipid which has been frequently associatedwith heart diseases - cholesterol. In fact, a diet with reduced cholesterolcontent may not be effective in lowering cholesterol level in the bodybecause the liver responds by producing more. The liver plays some important roles in blood clotting. It is the site ofproduction ofprothrombinand fibrinogen, substances essential to the formationof a blood clot. In addition, bile secreted by the liver aids in the absorptionof vitamin K by the intestine. Vitamin K is an essential cofactor inthe synthesis ofprothrombinand the plasma clotting cofactors.

{"question": "List the common types of registers used in the computer and statetheir purpose.", "solution": "There are nine types of registers in the computer. 1.Program Counter:This register holds the address of the instruction tobe executed. As the name implies, it is also a counter since instructions arelisted in memory sequentially (for the most part). 2.Instruction Register:This register holds the binary code of the instructionto be executed. 3.Memory Address Register (MAR):This register holds the address ofany type of data (instruction, operand, etc.) to be stored in, or recalled from, memory. 4.Memory Buffer Register (MBR):This register holds the data written frommemory until the appropriate register is ready to accept it. The MBR alsostores information that is to be transferred from a register into main memory. 5.Accumulator:This register stores temporary data during calculations. The accumulator always holds one of the operands in arithmeticoperations. 6.General Purpose Registers:These registers usually serve as temporarystorage for data and addresses. In some computers, the user mayspecify them as accumulators or program counters. If he wishes, the programmermay also use these registers for arithmetic calculations. 7.Index Register:This register holds a relative address which, when addedto the memory address, forms an effective address, that states the actuallocation of data. Thus, if the contents of the Index Register are changed, the same instructions can be used to handle data from different locations. Generally, the contents of the index register (XR or X) are addedto the numerical ad-dress of a symbol to calculate its absolute (actual) address in main memory. This numerical address is com-prised of adisplacement and the contents of a base register. The base register holdsthe address at which the program was stored in main memory upon itsentry.

{"question": "You are given 3-bromohexane. Draw the stereoisomers of this compound; specify the R and the S enantiomers.", "solution": "Non-superimposable mirror-image stereo- isomers are called enantiomers. It is not enough that a molecule has a mirror image, for everything has a mirror image; the mirror images must not be able to be superimposed on each other. The arrangement of atoms that characterize a particular stereoisomer is called its configuration. You want to specify the configuration in terms of R and S. Let us see what this means. In assigning configuration, you do the following after determining the chiral carbon: (1) Assign.a sequence of priority to the four atoms or groups of atoms attached to the chiral center. (A chiral center consists of a carbon atom to which 4 different groups are attached.) (2) Visualize the molecule so that the group of lowest priority is directed away from you. Now, observe the arrangement of the remaining groups. If, in going from the group of highest priority to the group of second priority your eye travels in a clockwise direction, the configuration is R; if counterclockwise, the configuration is S. Now, how do you determine priority? If the four atoms bonded to chiral center are all different, priority depends on atomic number. The atom of higher atomic number receives the higher priority. If they are isotopes, the higher mass number has priority. Now, if you can't determine priority from this, because you have 2 or more atoms that are the same attached to the chiral center, make a similar comparison of the next atoms (i.e., their atomic numbers) as you move out from the chiral center. With this in mind, you can proceed as follows: (a) 3-bromohexane. Recall, enantiomers are mirror image isomers so that you can say the enantiomers I and II, where the asterisk designates the chiral carbon. To specify R and S, the lowest priority group must be drawn away from you. H has the lowest priority since it has the smallest atomic number. It can be drawn away from you by placing it in a vertical position. By con-vention, groups in vertical positions are considered away from you. Thus, you can rewrite these enantiomers as shown in figure B. The hydrogens attached to the chiral center are now vertical, and, as such, away from us. The other groups surrounding the chiral center are Br, CH_2CH_3, and CH_2CH_2CH_3. Of the three, Br has highest priority because its atomic number is higher than carbons. The other two have carbons attached to the chiral center, so that no priority is possible here. You must move out from the chiral center. The next atoms reached are, again, carbon. No priority determination is possible. If you move out to the next atom, you find a carbon atom in CH_2CH_2CH3and a hydrogen atom in CH_2CH_3 (it doesn't have another carbon). Thus, because carbon has a larger atomic number than hydrogen, CH_2CH_2CH_3 has priority over CH_2CH_3. In summary, for the groups or atoms attached to the chiral center, the order of increasing priority can be shown by Recalling step (2), in going from highest to next lowest, then to next lowest, in the enantiomer on the left, you move in a clockwise direction. For enantiomer I, you move in a counterclockwise direction. Thus it is S and enantiomer II is R.", "images": ["images/E20-0730_files/image002.jpg", "images/E20-0730_files/image004.jpg", "images/E20-0730_files/image006.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E20-0730.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": true, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Enantiomer I is S and enantiomer II is R"}
{"question": "What are some of the important properties and characteris-ticsofenyzmes?", "solution": "An important property of enzymes is their catalytic ability. Enzymes controlthe speed of many chemical reactions that occur in the cell. To understandthe efficiency of an enzyme, one can measure the rate at whichan enzyme operates - also called the turnover number. The turnovernumber is the number of molecules of substrate which is acted uponby a molecule of enzyme per second. Most enzymes have high turnovernumbers and are thus needed in the cell in relatively small amounts. The maximum turnover number ofcatalase, an enzyme which decomposeshydrogen peroxide, is 10^7 molecules/sec. It would require yearsfor an iron atom to accomplish the same task. A second important property of enzymes is their specificity, that is, thenumber of different substrates they are able to act upon. The surface ofthe enzyme reflects this specificity. Each enzyme has a region called a bindingsite to which only certain substrate molecules can bind efficiently. There are varying degrees of spe-cificity:urease, which decomposes urea toammonia and carbon dioxide, will react with no other substance; howeverlipase will hydrolyze the ester bonds of a wide variety of fats. Another aspect of enzymatic activity is the coupling of a spontaneousreaction with a non-spontaneous reaction.An energy- requiringreaction proceeds with an increase in free energy and is non- spontaneous. To drive this reaction, a spontaneous energy-yielding reactionoccurs at the same time. The enzyme acts by harnessing the energyof the energy-yielding reaction and transferring it to the energy- requiringreaction. Thestructure of different enzymes differsigni-ficantly. Some are composedsolely of protein (for example, pepsin). Others consist of two parts: a protein part (also called anapoenzyme) and a non-protein part, eitheran or-ganic coenzyme or an inorganic cofactor, such as a metal ion. Only when both parts are combined can activity occur. There are other important considerations.

{"question": "A ship is being towed by a tug by means of a steel wire. If the drag on the ship is equivalent to 2 \u00d7 10^6 lb, and if the breaking strain of the wire is 0.025, what is the smallest permissible diameter of wire that may be used?", "solution": "If the ship is being towed, it eventually settles down at a steady speed so that the force being exerted by the tow wire is equal and opposite to the drag on the ship.

Thus A = F_n1_0/Y\u22061, where F_n the normal force on the wire, is equal to the force exerted by the wire on the ship, which balances the drag force. (See the fig.) Further, the strain \u22061/1_0 must be less than 0.025, the strain at which the wire breaks.

What are the different kinds of mammalian teeth? What is the structure of a typical human tooth?", "solution": "The teeth of mammals are differentiated into four types: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. The incisors are usually simple teeth with a chisel-shaped cutting edge used for biting. In man, there are four incisors in the upper jaw and four in the lower. The canines are usually simple conical teeth which are often greatly enlarged, as in the tusks of the walrus, and are used for tearing food. Man has four canines, one on the side of each jaw. The premolars and molars are often spoken of together as cheek teeth. These teeth have flattened, ridged surfaces, and function in grinding, pounding, and crushing food. Behind the canines in man, there are two premolars and three molars on each side of each jaw. A child's first set of teeth does not include all those mentioned above; the first (or milk) teeth are lost as the child gets older, being replaced with permanent teeth that have been growing in the gums. The final permanent set of teeth totals 32 in man. A typical tooth consists of a crown, neck, and root. The part projecting above the gum is the crown; that surrounded by the gum is the neck; below the neck is the root, embedded in the jawbone. The body of a tooth is composed of dentin, which resembles bone in its structure, chemical components, hardness, and development. The crown is covered with a layer of enamel the hardest substance in the body, and the root is fastened to the jawbone by a layer of cement.

{"question": "Calculate the magnitude of the gravitational red shift for a photon traveling from the sun to the earth.", "solution": "Because of Einstein's Mass-Energy Relation, any object having energy E has an equivalent mass m = E/c^2 where c is the speed of light. If the \"object\" is a photon, E = h\u0475 and the equivalent mass is m = h\u0475 /c^2(1) where h is Planck's constant. Now, we may ask, what happens if a photon is in a gravitational field? In traveling between 2 points in this field the potential energy of the photon changes. Hence, so must its total energy, E. We may write E' = E + (\\textphi' - \\textphi)(2) where \\textphi' - \\textphi is the change in potential energy of the photon, and E' is its new energy as a result of moving in the gravitational field. Rewriting(2) E' - E = \\textphi' - \\textphi or h\u0475' - h\u0475 = \\textphi' - \\textphi whence, h( \u0475' - \u0475) = \\textphi' - \\textphi Hence, we expect the photon to undergo a frequency shift of \u0475' - \u0475 = [(1/h)(\\textphi' - \\textphi)](3) as a result of a change in the potential energy of the photon. If the photon travels from the surface of the sun to the surface of the earth, the primed variables will refer to the surface of the earth.

{"question": "Describe the early development and implantation of the human embryo.", "solution": "The ovum must be fertilized while in the upper regions of the Fallopian tube or oviduct to develop suc-cessfully. Upon fertilization, it begins the series of cell divisions and differentiation which will eventually lead to development of the embryo (see Figure 1). The fertilized ovum continues its passage through the oviduct to the uterus, which requires three to four days. Once in the uterus, the egg floats free in the intrauterine fluid, from which it receives nutrients for several more days. During this time, it continues dividing and begins to differentiate into the blastocyst. The blastocyst stage (a fluid-filled sphere of cells) is attained by the time or shortly after the egg reaches the uterus. The egg would have slowly disintegrated during its passage to the uterus if fertilization had not occurred. While the egg had been traveling to the uterus, the uterus was being prepared under the combined stimula-tion of estrogen and progesterone to receive the egg. If the fertilized egg were to pass too quickly through the oviduct, it would reach the uterus prematurely, when both it and the uterus had not yet reached a suitable state for implantation. For the egg, the necessary event for implantation is the disintegration of the zona pellucida, a remnant of the Figure 1Schematic diagram of the maturation of an egg in a follicle in the ovary following its release (ovulation). a) fertilization in the upper part of the oviduct b) early cleavage as it desends c) late cleavage continuing desent d) blastocyst development in the uterus before implantation e) implantation of blastocyst in the wall of the uterus. follicle. This disintegration is completed at the blasto-cyst stage. The blastocyst is composed of an outer layer of specialized cells called trophoblasts, which are re-sponsible for implantation, and an inner cell mass destined to become the fetus itself. The trophoblast layer, upon disintegration of the zona pellucida, enlarges and adheres to the uterine wall. These trophoblasts secrete lytic en-zymes which will digest the uterine endometrium, allowing the blastocyst to completely embed itself in the uterine lining. This digestion of tissue continues for a period, with the breakdown products of the endometrium serving as a nutrient source for the developing embryo until both the fetal circulation and the placenta have developed. The placenta will form from an intermeshing of the trophoblast layer with the endometrium, and provides for contact and nutrient exchange between the mother and the fetus. In addition to enzymes, the trophoblast secrets hor-mones, including chorionic gonadotropin. This important hormone is necessary for retention of the corpus luteum, which would have involuted if its ovum had not been fert-ilized. The hormonal secretions of the corpus luteum and later the placenta, maintain the uterus in the proper condition for pregnancy and prevent menstruation. Detection of the presence of chorionic gonadotropin in the urine is the basis for most pregnancy tests. Because of the time required for the ovum to traverse the oviduct and for the uterus to be prepared, the total time that elapses from ovulation to implantation is from seven to eleven days.", "images": ["images/F22-0582_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F22-0582.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The ovum must be fertilized in the upper regions of the Fallopian tube.

We are told that all the F_1 offspring are plump and colored. This indicates that the genotypes of these offspring are either SSCC or SsCC, because they show the dominant trait. Now we must decide which one of the two alternatives is correct. This is where the F_2 comes in. If the F_1 plants were SSCC, only offspring expressing the dominant trait could have been produced in the F_2, since the other parent in the test cross was a homozygous recessive. All offspring would have been heterozygous, and in such a state would have expressed only the plump and colored traits. However, four phenotypes were actually produced in the F_1, including the homozygous recessive (shrunken, colorless). Therefore, the F_1 parent had to have carried a copy of both types of recessive genes. The genotype of the F_1 is then SsCc. Since we are told that both parents of the F_1 off-spring were homozygous, their genotypes must be either SSCC and sscc, with phenotypes plump, colored and shrunken, colorless respectively or SScc and ssCC with phenotypes plump, colorless and shrunken, colored re- spectively. We illustrate this with a diagramatic cross: b)Now, looking at the ratios of offspring in the F_2 generation, we see that Now, looking at the ratios of offspring in the F_2 generation, we see that there is a significant departure from the expected 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 ratio when a test cross of a heterozygote with a recessive homozygote is performed. This is indicative of crossover. (See previous problems for more detailed explanation of this and other concepts of linkage). Looking at the ratios in the F_2 generation, we see that the larger groups, which represent the parental linkage combinations, are plump, colored and shrunken, colorless.

We have determined the F_1 genotype to be SsCc. Therefore, in the F_1, the genes are linked .

{"question": "Using methyl orange as an indicator, a solution of unknown pH was matched to a Bjerrum wedge at a point where the acid wedge was 40 percent of the total thickness of the combined wedges. This point is indicated by the arrow in the diagram. Determine the pH of the solution.", "solution": "From the Bjerrum wedge, the ratio of the concentration of methyl orange indicator in basic solution ([Ind^-]) to the concentration in acid solution ([HInd]) will be determined. This ratio will then be used to find the pH of the unknown solution. A Bjerrum wedge is a glass box divided into two wedge-shaped compartments by a glass plate placed diagonal-ly in the box (see diagram, above). In one compartment is placed an acidic solution of the chosen indicator (HInd) and into the other a basic solution of the indicator (Ind^-). The concentration of indicator is the same in both wedges. A view from the top will produce a continuum of color varying from that of pure HInd on one side to that of pure Ind^- on the other. A solution of indicator of the same concentration as the Bjerrum wedge is prepared using a solution of unknown pH. The resulting solution is then placed in a glass box having a thickness equal to that of the Bjerrum wedge. The boxes are placed side- by-side and the color of the unknown solution is matched to a color on the Bjerrum wedge. At the point where the two colors match, let the acidic wedge be x percent of the total thickness of the box. Then the basic wedge is 100 - x percent of the total thickness. The ratio [lnd^-]/[HInd] is then [Ind^-]/[HInd] = [(100 - x)/x] . In this problem, the acidic wedge is 40 percent the total thickness, hence [Ind^-]/[Hind] = [(100 - 40)/40] = (60/40) . To make use of this ratio, we need an expression relating the pH to [lnd^-]/[HInd]. Consider the dissociation of acidic indicator: HInd + H_2O \\rightleftarrows H_3O^+ + Ind^-. The equilibrium constant, K_a , for this reaction is K_a = [H_3O^+] \u00d7 ([Ind^-] / [HInd]) . Taking the logarithm of both sides and multiplying by negative one gives - log K_a = - log [H_3O^+] - log ([Ind^-]/[Hind]) . - log K_a = pK_aand- log [H_3O^+] = pH. Hence, pK_a = pH - log ([Ind^-]/[Hind]) , or,pH = pK_a + log ([Ind^-]/[Hind]) . For methyl orange, pK_a = 3.7.

The air temperature is T_0 = 0\\textdegree C. The density of air is d_0 = 1.29 \u00d7 10^-3 g cm-3at 0\\textdegree C.", "solution": "Let us assume that initially the chimney has no smoke. The pressure A (see the figure) is the sum of the air pressure P_B at B plus the pressure at A due to the air column in the chimney P_A = P_B + gd_0h where g is the gravitational acceleration, and d_0 is the density of air at T_0 = 0\\textdegreeC. When hot smoke fills the chimney, the temperature inside becomes T_1. We can take the density of the smoke air mixture as approximately equal to that of the air d1at T_1. The pressure at A in this case, is P'_A = P_B + gd_1h. Right before A, where hot air is being produced, pres-sure is equal to the air pressure P_A. Since P'_A < P_A, hot air is pushed upward by the difference \u2206P = P_A - P'_A= gh(d_0 - d_1). We can arrive at this result in a simpler manner if we realize that the warm air in the chimney is less dense than the surrounding cold air and is in touch with the cold air at the two ends of the chimney. Hence, as a result of Archimedes' principle for fluids, hot air will be buoyed up with a force equal to the weight of the cold air displaced by the warm air. The net force \u2206F acting on the warm air column therefore equals the difference between this buoyant force and the weight of the warm air \u2206F = gd_0V - gd_1V = gAh(d_0 - d_1). The resulting draught pressure \u2206P is \u2206P = \u2206F/A = gh(d_0 - d_1). Let us assume that air can be thought of as an ideal gas. We do not expect the pressure inside the chimney to differ appreciably from the outside pressure since it is mainly the higher temperature that determines the volume of the warm air: V \\approx Constant \u00d7 temperature. Under the assumption that pressure is approximately constant, the volume of a gas at two different temperatures T_1 and T_0 obeys the relation V_0/V_1 = T_0/T_1. The mass of air in both cases is the same Mass = V_0d_0 = V_1d_1. giving V_0/V_1 = d_1/d0 The density of warm air at T_1\\textdegree C is related to the density of air at 0\\textdegreeC by d_1 = d_0(T_0/T_1).

This reaction is a homogeneous reaction in the gaseous phase. It can be investigated kinetically by following the change in pressure of the gaseous mixture as the reaction proceeds. The pressure drops because 3 moles of gaseous reactants are converted to two moles of gaseous products. Since the reactants are being used up during the course of the reaction, their concentrations and their rate if reaction are constantly changing. The concentrations and rates listed are those at the very beginning of the reaction, when little change has occurred. From the data given, one can see that when the initial pressure of NO is halved with the pressure of H2 remaining constant, the initial rate is quartered . When the pressure of H_2 is halved and the NO remains constant, the initial rate is halved . When the pressure of H_2 is doubled and NO remains constant, the rate doubles.

For our purposes, it is sufficient to retain only the first two digits: R = 6.5 \u00d7 10^6m The gravitational pull on the satellite is F_g = mg.

{"question": "If all the chemical components found in a living cell were to beput together in the right proportion, the mixture would not functionas living matter. What characteristics would enable usto consider something living?", "solution": "Living things are characterized by a specific, complex organization: thesimplest functional unit of organization is the cell. The cell possesses a membrane, called the plasma membrane, which delimits its living substancesfrom the surroundings. It also has a nucleus which is a specializedregion of the cell controlling many important life processes. Living things have to consume energy in order to stay alive. This energymust come from food; plants (with some exceptions) have the abilityto manufacture their own food from sunlight and inorganic materials inthe soil and air. Animals, lacking this ability, have to depend ultimately onplants for food. Complex food substances are taken in and degraded intosimpler ones; and in the process, energy is liberated to carry out life sustainingfunctions. Living things are characterized by their ability to move. The movementof most animals is quite obvious - they crawl, swim, climb, run orfly. The movements of plants are much slower and less apparent, but nonethelessdo occur. A few animals, for example sponges and corals, aresedentary - they do not move from place to place. To procure food and othernecessities of life, these animals rely on the beating of hair-like projections, called cilia, to move their surroundings (from which they obtaintheir food) past their body. The ability to respond to physical or chemical changes in their immediatesurrounding is another charac-teristic of living things. Higher animalshave special-ized cells or complex organs to respond to certain typesof stimuli. Plants also show irritability; the VenusFlytrapis a remarkableexample. The presence of an insect on the leaf of this plant stimulatesthe leaf to fold; the edges come together and ensnare the fly. The fly provides a source of nitrogen for the VenusFlytrap. Living things grow, that is, increase in cellular mass. This growth canbe brought about by an increase in the size of individual cells, by an increasein the number of cells, or both. Some organisms, such as most trees, will grow indefinitely, but most animals have a definite growth period whichterminates in an adult form of a characteristic size or age. Another characteristic of living things is the ability to reproduce. No organismcan live forever; hence there must be some way for it to leave descendantsthat can continue its kind on earth. There are a variety of reproductionmechanisms. Some simple organisms split into two after havingattained a certain size. Higher organisms have complex reproductivepatterns involving partners of the opposite sex. The ability of a plant or animal to adapt to its environment is anothercharacteristic of living things. It enables an organism to survive theexigencies of a changing world.

Thus, to find the \u2206E\\textdegree for each of these pairs, you need to know the E\\textdegree of the half- reactions. There is one other important fact to be kept in mind.

{"question": "A chemist decides to react 2 g of VO (vanadium oxide) with 5.75 g of Fe_2 O_3 to produce V_2 O_5 andFeO. How many grams of V_2 O_5 can be obtained?", "solution": "It is extremely important to write out a balanced equation that illustrates this chemical re-action. The balanced equation for this reaction is: 2VO + 3Fe_2 O_3 \\rightarrow 6FeO + V_2 O_5 The coefficients tell us the relative number of moles of each reactant and the relative number of moles of each product. For example, 2molesof VO will react for every three moles of Fe_2 O_3. To find the amount of V_2 O_5, therefore, you must first determine how many moles of V_2 O_5 will be generated. To do this you must know the number of moles of the reactants. moles of VO= [(weight in grams) / (molecular weight)] = [(2.00 g) / (66.94 g/mole)] = .0299 moles moles of Fe_2 O_3 = [(5.75 g) / (159.69 g/mole)] = .0360 moles According to the equation, the number of moles of VO must be 2/3 the number of moles of Fe_2 O_3 . However, 2/3 of .0360 = .0240, but you only have .0299 moles. This means that VO is in excess. In other words, for the amount of Fe_2 O_3 present, there exists more VO than will react. As such, the products produced will depend on the number of moles of Fe_2 O_3, and not on VO. Fe_2 O_3 is called the limiting reagent. In general, then, if you have two quantities that are known, and want to compute a third, you determine the limiting reagent. The unknown quantity will be dependent upon it only. As stated earlier, the number of moles of Fe_2 O_3 was .0360. According to the reaction, for every 3molesof Fe_2 O_3, one mole of V_2 O_5 is generated. Therefore, the number of moles of V_2 O_5 = 1/3 (.0360) = .0120. Recalling the definition of the mole, you have for V_2 O_5 : .0120 moles = no. of grams/molecular weight.

{"question": "Explain how speciation by hybridization occurs. Contrast it withspeciation by geographic isolation.", "solution": "Occasionally members of two different but closely related species maycross and successfully produce viable hybrid offspring. Such hybrids oftwo different species, however, are usually not fertile. Their unlike chromosomescannot pair in meiosis, and the resulting eggs and sperm donot receive the proper assortment of chromosomes. The hybrids, therefore, cannot continue their genetic line unless their chromosomes undergosome change that will allow them to synapse. One such change, whichhas been frequently observed in some species of plants, is the doublingof chromosomes in the gametes. This results in the production of tetraploidsfrom the normal diploids. In thetetraploidprogenysynapsiscan occurbetween dup-licated chromosomes, meiosis can take place in a normalfashion, and normal fertile eggs and sperm will be produced. Thereafter, thetetraploidhybrids will breed true, but will be unable to crosswith either of the pa-rental types. This is because a cross between a tetraploidhybrid and a diploid parent will produce triploid off-spring, which, becauseof the highly irregular distribution of their chromosomes at meiosis, are sterile. Thus, thetetraploidhybrids (or any otherpolyploids withan even chromosome number) become a new, distinct species. Through hybridization, the best characters of each of the original speciesmay be combined in descendents better able to survive than the originalspecies, and the worst combined in descendents that are doomed tobe eli-minated by natural selection. Hence, hybridization tends to producenew species that are better adapted than the parental species. As was previously seen, hybridization with doubling of chromosomesproduces new species with characteristics bridging the two parentalspecies. In such cases, there is a convergence of characteristics. Geographic isolation, in contrast tends to produce new species with divergingcharacteristics. Where hybridization results in formation of one speciesfrom two parental forms, geographic isolation results in two or more distinct species from one common parental form.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F27-0725.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Speciation by hybridization occurs when members of two different but closely related species cross and produce viable hybrid offspring.

{"question": "Isendosporeformation in bacteria a method of reproduction ? Explain.", "solution": "To answer this question, it is necessary to examine the results of spore formation. Some bacteria have the capacity to transform themselves into highly resistant cells calledendospores. In a process known as sporulation , bacteria form theseintracelluarspores in order to survive adverse conditions, such as extremely dry, hot, or cold environments. Each smallendosporedevelops within a vegetative cell. The vegetative cell is the form in which these bacteria grow and reproduce. Each endospore contains DNA in addition to essential materials derived from the vegetative cell. All bacterial spores containdipicolinicacid, a substance not found in the vegetative form. It is believed that a complex of calcium ion,dipicolinicacid, andpeptidoglycanforms the cortex or outer layer of theendospore. This layer or coat helps the spore to resist the destructive effects of both physical and chemical agents. Thedipicolinic acid/calcium complex may play a role in resuming metabolism during germination. The spore is generally oval or spherical in shape and smaller than the bacterial cell. Once theendosporeis mature, the remainder of the vegetative cell may shrink and disintegrate. When the spores are transferred to an environment favorable for growth, they germinate and break out of the spore wall, and the germinating spore develops into a new vegetative cell. Theendosporeis incapable of growth or multiplication. Endospore formation is neither a kind of reproduction nor a means of multiplication, since only one spore is formed per bacterial cell. During spore formation, a singleendosporeis present within the bacterium. The remaining portion of the vegetative cell dies off, while theendospore remains to later germinate into a new vegetative cell. This new vegetative cell is identical to the old one because it contains the same DNA. Spores only represent a dormant phase during the life of the bacterial cell. This phase is initiated by adverse environmental conditions. Bacteria in the generaBacillusandClostridiumare partially characterized by their ability to formendospores.

{"question": "Draw a typical bacterial growth curve and label the different phases. Discuss the factors for the existence of each phase.", "solution": "If one inoculates a flask of nutrient broth with a given number of bacteria and follows the rate of growth during the incubation period, there is found a series of different growth rates. A plot of the logarithms of the number of cells versus time is used to illustrate the growth curve, which is shown in the following diagram: There is an initial period of no growth, followed by one of rapid growth, and then there is a leveling off. The last period is one of decline in the population. The curved portions designates the transitional period between phases. These represent periods where the bacteria enter a new phase. Following the addition of inoculum into the new medium, the bacterial population does not increase but each individual bacterium increases in size. During this period, called the lag phase, the bacteria are physiologically active and are adapting to the new environment, but the bacterial population number remains constant. In addition, the bacteria may alter the environment for their means (eg. exretion of CO_2 to lower pH, so that more favorable growth conditions are achieved.) At the end of the lag phase, the bacteria start to divide. The lag phase is followed by the logarithmic or exponen-tial phase where the cells divide at a constant and maximal rate according to their generation time. Most of the bacteria during this phase are uniform in terms of metabolic activity, unlike the other phases. After the log phase, growth begins to level off in the stationary phase. The population remains constant because of a cessation of reproduction or an equalization of growth and death rates. The decreased growth is usually due to the exhaustion of nutrients or the production of toxic or inhi-bitory products. The final phase is called the death phase. Here, the bacteria die faster than they are being produced, if any reproduction is occurring at all. Depletion of nutrients and accumulation of inhibitory products, such as acid, cause the increased death rate. The number of bacteria increases exponentially in the log phase, and the number of bacteria decreases exponentially in the death phase.

{"question": "Name the major organs of the human digestive tract and explain their functions.", "solution": "The human digestive system begins at the oral cavity. The teeth break up food by mechanical means, in-creasing the substrates' surface area available to the action of digestive enzymes. There are four types of teeth. The chisel-shaped incisors are used for biting, while the pointed canines function in tearing, and the flattened, ridged premolars and molars are used for grinding and crushing food. In addition to tasting, the tongue mani-pulates food and forms it into a semi-spherical ball (bolus) with the aid of saliva. The salivary glands consist of three pairs of glands. The parotid glands, located in the cheek in front of the ear, produce only watery saliva which dissolves dry foods. The submaxillary and sublingual glands, located at the base of the jaw and under the tongue, produce watery and mucous saliva which coagulates food particles and also lubricates the throat for the passage of the bolus. Saliva also contains amylases which break down starches. The tongue pushes the bolus into the pharynx which is the cavity where the esophagus and trachea (windpipe) meet (see Fig. 2). The larynx is raised against the epiglottis and the glottis is closed, preventing food from passing into the trachea. The act of swallowing initiates the movement of food down through a tube con-necting the mouth to the stomach called the esophagus. Once inside the esophagus, the food is moved by involuntary peristaltic waves towards the stomach. At the junc-tion of the stomach and the esophagus, is a special ring of muscles called the lower esophageal sphincter. These muscles are normally contracted, but when food from the esophagus reaches the sphincter, it opens reflexively and allows food to enter the stomach. The stomach is a thick muscular sac positioned on the left side of the body just beneath the ribs. The upper region of the stomach, closest to the heart, is called the cardiac region. Below that is the crescent part of the sac called the fundus. The pyloric region is tubular and connects the stomach to the small intestines. The wall of the stomach is made up of three thick layers of muscle. One layer is composed of longitudinal, one of circular, and the other of oblique (diagonal) fibers. The powerful contractions of these muscles break up the food, mix it with gastric juice and move it down the tract. Gastric juice is a mixture of hydrochloric acid and enzymes that further digest the food. Gastric juice and mucus are se-creted by the small gastric glands in the lining of the stomach. The mucus helps protect the stomach from its own digestive enzymes and acid. The partially digested food, called chyme, is pushed through the pyloric sphincter in-to the small intestine. The pyloric sphincter is similar in structure and function to the lower esophageal sphincter. The first part of the small intestine, called the duodenum, is held in a fixed position. The rest of the intestine is held loosely in place by a thin membrane called mesentery which is attached to the back of the body wall. In the duodenum, bile from the liver that has been stored in the gallbladder is mixed with pancreatic juice from the pancreas. The secretions of the pancreas and glandular cells of the intestinal tract contain enzymes that finish digesting the food. As digestion continues in the lower small intestine, muscular contractions mix the food and move it along. Small finger-like protrusions, called villi, line the small intestine facing the lumen. They greatly increase the intestinal surface area and it is through the villi that most of the nutrient absorption takes place. The small intestine joins the large intestine (colon) at the cecum. The cecum is a blind sac that has the appendix protruding from one side. Neither the appendix nor the cecum are functional. At the junction of the cecum and the lower small intestine (ileum.) is a sphincter called the ileocecal valve. Undigested food passes through this valve into the large intestine. The large intestine has the function of removing water from the unabsorbed material. At times there is an excretion of certain calcium and iron salts when their concentrations in the blood are too high. Large numbers of bacteria exist in the colon. Their function in man is not fully understood, but some can synthesize vitamin K which is of great importance to man's blood clotting mechanism. The last section of the colon stores feces until it is excreted through the anal sphincter.", "images": ["images/F17-0422_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F17-0422.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The major organs of the human digestive tract are the oral cavity, salivary glands, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine.

Until the advent of quantum theory, the nature of the magnetic force of a magnet was not well understood. The concept of magnetic pole strength due to a magnetic pole was then de-veloped in a manner analogous to the concept of electric field strength and charge.

{"question": "Compare the events of mitosis with the events of meiosis, consider chromosome duplication, centromere duplication, cytoplasmic division and homologous chromosomes in making the comparisons.", "solution": "In mitosis, the chromosomes are duplicated once, and the cytoplasm divides once. In this way, two identical daughter cells are formed, each with the same chromosome number as the mother cell. In meiosis, however, the chromosomes are duplicated once, but the cytoplasm divides two times, resulting in four daughter cells having only half the diploid chromosomal complement. This difference arises in the fact that there is no real interphase, and thus no duplication of chromosomal material, between the two meiotic divisions. In mitosis, there is no pairing of homologous chromosomes in prophase as there is in meiosis. Identical chromatids joined by their centromere are separated when the centromere divides. In meiosis, duplicated homologous chromosomes pair, forming tetrads. The daughter chromatids of each homolog are joined by a centromere as in mitosis, but it does not split in the first meiotic division. The centromeres of each duplicated member of the homologous pair are joined in the tetrad, and it is these centromeres which separate from one another in anaphase of meiosis I. Thus the first meiotic division results in two haploid daughter cells, each having chromosomes composed of two identical chromatids. Only in meiosis II, after the reduc-tion division has already occurred, does the centromere joining daughter chromatids split as in mitosis, thus separating identical chromosomes.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F25-0644.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "In mitosis, chromosomes are duplicated once and the cytoplasm divides once, resulting in two identical daughter cells.

{"question": "Why do ecologists not attempt to divide the ocean intobiome typeslike those on land? How do they insteaddistinguish thedifferent parts of the ocean?", "solution": "Because of the vastness and relative uniformity of the ocean, and thecomparatively rapid mixing of the organisms within it, the various regionsof the ocean cannot be divided into distinct biome types as are terrestrialregions. Even though the ocean is charac-terized by many differenttypes of habitats, these habi-tats are all interconnected, and some organismsmay move freely from one to the other. It seems more appropriate, therefore, to describe an ocean byzonationrather than by biometypes. The oceans and seas cover 71 per cent of the earth's surface, but, exceptfor the shallow water of the margins, they are far less complex in structureand productivity than the land. The continental margin gradually slopesseaward to depths of 150 to 200 meters and then slopes steeply to depthsof 3000 meters or more. This slope is known as the continental shelf. The continental shelf then gives way to the abyssal ocean floor. The accompanying figure depicts thezonationin an ocean. Waters overthe continental shelf comprise theneriticzone, and these beyond the edgeof the shelf comprise the main part of the ocean basin, called the oceaniczone. The floor of the ocean basin, called the abyssal plain, rangesfrom 3000 to 5000 meters in depth and may be marked by such featuresas sea mounts, ridges and trenches. The oceanic zone is further distinguishableinto four zones. The upper part of the open ocean into whichenough light can penetrate is called theeuphoticzone. Below this zoneis thebathyalzone, which ranges to a depth of perhaps 2,000 meters. Below thebathyalzone, the waters over the abyssalplain .(ocean floor) form the abyssal zone. Trenches and valleys of the ocean floor form thetidal zone, which is generally below 6,000 meters. Theeuphoticzone, usually about 100 meters in thickness, has enoughpenetrated sunlight effective for photosynthesis. Below this is a transitionzone where some light penetrates. From the transition zone downto the ocean floor, total darkness prevail and this region constitutes theaphoticzone. The exact boundary between the lighted zone and the deeplightless zone at any given locality depends upon the intensity of the sunlight, which in turn depends upon the latitude, and upon the turbidity of thewater. Usually no light penetrates below 600 meters. The physical environment of the ocean is most diverse in the shallowwater along its margin. Here in theneritic(coastal) zone exists the greatestvariation in temperature, salinity, lightintesityand turbulence. Also, here, sunlight can penetrate to the bottom of the water body. For this reason, here occurs the most luxuriant forms of both plant and animal life. The edge of the ocean, which rises and falls with the tide, is the intertidal zoneor littoral zone. It extends out into the water to the depths at which thewater is no longer stirred by tides and waves. The region after the intertidalzone is called thesubtidalzone and farther on is the lowerneritic region. In general, the density of living organisms in the open ocean is muchless than that found in theneriticregion, but because of its large areaand volume, the total biomass in the open ocean is greater.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F30-0786.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "Ocean is described by zonation rather than biome types"}
{"question": "Describe the composition and structure of the plant cell wall.", "solution": "Because plant cells must be able to withstand high osmotic pressure differences, they require rigid cell walls to prevent bursting. This rigidity is provided primarily by cellulose, the most abundant cell wall component in plants. Cellulose, a polysaccharide, is a long, linear, unbranched polymer of glucose molecules. In the cell wall cellulose molecules are organized in bundles of parallel chains to form fibrils. The fibrils are often arranged in criss-cross layers reinforced and held together by three other polymeric materials: pectin and hemicellulose (complex polysaccharides) and extensin (a complex glycoprotein). Lignin is an addi-tional polymeric substance found in the wood of trees. Together these substances provide a matrix capable of withstanding enormous stress. A layer known as the middle lamella lies between and is shared by adjacent cells. The lamella is composed primarily of pectin. By binding the cells together, it provides additional stiffness to the plant. The cell wall is usually interrupted at various locations by plasmodesmata. These, are tiny holes in the cell walls through which run protoplasmic connections between adjacent cells. This provides for intercellular exchange of such materials as water and dissolved sub- stances.

In the declare statement BIT_STRING is the name of a bit string variable. A bit string variable can take bit string data as values, just as arithmeticvariables take on numeri-cal values. A bit string constant consists of a sequence of one or more of the digits0 and 1. The constant is enclosed within quotes. The terminating quotessymbol is immediately followed by the letter B indicating a bit string. e.g.'111'B means that 111 is a bit string. (3)'101'B means that 101101101 is a bit string. ''Bmeans a null length bit string. Any bit string variable must always be explicitly de-clared as in the givenexample. The bit attribute consists of the keyword BIT followed by aninteger enclosed in paren-theses indicating the length of the bit string. Hence (4) in the DCL statement specifies the length of the variable named asBIT_STRING. The attribute VARYING specifies that the variable BIT_STRING is of varying length, and its maximum length is 4. The bit stringvariable can also be initialized using the attribute INITIAL. e.g. DECLARE INTEREST VARYING BIT(5) INITIAL(' 011 'B); initializesthe variable INTEREST to the bit string value 011. The second statement in the given program is a value ac-quisition statement. The rules regarding value acquisition are that all data on the datacard (input stream) be in the form of bit string constants without repetitionfactors. If the value in the input is longer in length than the declaredlength, truncation occurs and the rightmost excess digits are deleted. e.g. If on the data card we have '001100'B then, the value acquired will be BIT_STRING=0011. Thus, the last two bits are truncated. Similarly, if the value specified in the input is shorter in length than thedeclared length, padding, by means of zero bits occurs at the right. e.g. If on the data card the value is '01'B then, the value acquired by the BIT_STRING is equal to 0100. No padding occurs if the VARYING attribute is used. The third statement in the given program is of decision making, usingbbit strings. The variable which is named as BIT_STRING is tested, b inorder to arrive at a certain decision. For decision-making, the PL/I machine accepts a bit string of arbitrarylength. The True path is taken if the bit string contains at least onebit with the value 1. The False path is taken if none of the bits in the stringhas the value one. The null string ' 'B does not contain any bit; the False path is taken if a null string is present. In the same third statement the second part involves value disposition(PUT statement). It prints out the value of BIT_STRING and alsoprints out the remark depending on the decision which is made.

{"question": "A hungry chimpanzee is able to solve the problem of getting a banana that is out of reach by stacking boxes on top of one another. Explain.", "solution": "This type of behavior is called insight learning. Considered to be the highest form of learning, it is most prevalent in primates and man. Insight is the ability to respond correctly on the first and sub-sequent trials to problems not encountered before. The animal is able to apply its prior learning experience in other situations to a new problem and solve the problem without having to use a trial-and-error process. In the situation given, the chimpanzee used insight to solve a problem it had never encountered before. Insight is the ability to incorporate concepts and prin-ciples with past experience in order to solve problems. During his survey of the problem, the chimp might mentally or visually internalize a trial-and-error process. By mentally integrating several elements ori-ginally learned separately, the chimpanzee can figure out the solution without doing the actual trial-and-error process and learning by mistake. In humans, insight learning is often referred to as reasoning. Dogs and cats demonstrate lack of insight or reasoning by being unable to perform well on detour tests. Detour tests are the simplest techniques used to investigate problem- solution capacities in animals. In these tests, an animal is blocked from a direct approach to food which he can see and smell by a barrier. In order to get to the food he must first walk away from the food and detour around the barrier (Fig. 1).

In view of this, why is there such a diversity of organic compounds present?", "solution": "The diversity of organic compounds is so vast that these organic compounds have been divided into families, such as alkanes, alkynes and aromatic compounds, which have no counterparts among inorganic compounds. The tremendous variety of these compounds is made possible by the unique properties of carbon. To be able to understand how carbon can form such a huge number of compounds with a great variety of properties, the way in which the atoms in these molecules are bonded together must be looked at. Carbon has a valence number (the number of bonds an atom of an element can form) of four. This means that each carbon atom always has four bonds which can be either bonded to four other atoms, as in methane; to three other atoms, as in formaldehyde; or to 2 other atoms as in hydrogen cyanide. In other words carbon is capable of forming single, double and triple bonds: But the diversity this element possesses does not stop here. It is capable of bonding to other carbon atoms in an almost unique variety of chain and ring structures. This property is called catenation and accounts for the tremendous variety seen in the following compounds: These examples show the use of a minimum number of carbon atoms. The diversity possible is apparent when one considers the fact that these different types of bond can be joined together in infinite numbers. To exemplify this, look at the compound: As it can be seen, a multitude of different variations could be made with the only constraining factor being that carbon must have four bonds. The freedom allowed carbon is apparent when contrasted with the halogens (iodine, chlorine, bromine, and flourine) which are monovalent and thus can only form one bond, for example: H-ClBr-Br hydrochloric acidbromine Another feature of the compounds of carbon that contributes to their variety is the existence of isomers (compounds composed of the same number and kind of atoms, but with the atoms arranged differently in space). Look, for example, at the compound C_4H_10. This can exist as: Although these compounds have the same chemical formulas they have different chemical, physical and biological properties due to their arrangement in space.", "images": ["images/F01-0012_files/image002.jpg", "images/F01-0012_files/image004.jpg", "images/F01-0012_files/image006.jpg", "images/F01-0012_files/image008.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F01-0012.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The diversity of organic compounds is due to the unique properties of carbon, its ability to form single, double and triple bonds, its capability of bonding to other carbon atoms in a variety of chain and ring structures, and the existence of isomers."}
{"question": "Describe the growth zones of a typical root.", "solution": "The tip of each root is covered by a protective root cap, a thimble-shaped group of cells. This root cap protects the rapidly growing meristemic region of the root tip. The outer part of the root cap is rough and uneven because its cells are constantly being worn away as the root pushes its way through the soil. The meristem, protected by the root cap, consists of actively dividing cells from which all the other tissues of the root are formed. It also gives rise to new root cap cells to replace the ones that are sloughed off. Immediately behind the meristem is the zone of elongation. The cells of this zone remain undifferen-tiated but grow rapidly in length by taking in large amounts of water. The meristematic region and the zone of elongation together account for the increase in length In the zone of maturation (or differentiation) of the root cells differentiate into the permanent tissues of the root, for example, the xylem and the phloem tissues. Present in this region too, are slender, elongated, hairlike projections called root hairs that arise laterally. There is one root hair to each epidermal cell. Root hairs greatly increase the surface area of the root and enhance the absorption of the water and minerals into the root. As the root elongates, the delicate, short--lived root hairs wither and die, and are replaced by the ones newly formed by the meristematic region. Root hairs occur only in a short lower segment of the zone of maturation, usually only 1 to 6 cm long.", "images": ["images/F10-0242_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F10-0242.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The growth zones of a typical root include the root cap, meristemic region, zone of elongation, and zone of maturation."}
{"question": "What are some factors that interfere with our obtaining a completeand unbiased picture of life in the past from a study ofthe fossil strata?", "solution": "There are five major rock strata in the earth's crust, each of which is subdividedinto lesser strata. Theoretically, because the strata were formedby the chronological deposition of sediment, the charac-teristics of eachancient era or period should become evident upon examining the fossilcomposition of each stratum and substratum. Also, one should be ableto estimate the duration of each era or period from the thickness of eachlayer and the known rate of sediment deposition. Knowledge of the fossil strata has been useful in the past and is still beingused today in those cases when radioactive dating is not applicable. In relative dating, a time or era can be assigned to a fossil or ar-tifact relativeto other fossils or artifacts of known age in otherstata. But this viewis oversimplified. The relative length of each ancient epoch cannot, in reality, be determined in great accuracy since the rate of sedi-mentary depositionvaried at different times and in different places. While the layers ofsedimentary rock should occur in the sequence of their deposition, with thenewer, later strata on top of the older, earlier ones, geologic disturbancesat some point of history may have changed the order and relationshipof the layers. It is known that certain sections of theearth's crusthave undergone tremendousfoldingsandsplittings, and old layers maynow cover new ones. In addition, in some regions, the strata formed previouslyhave emerged from the sea due to the continuous addition of newlayers; the top layers were then very easily carried away by running wateror other natural disturbances, so that re-latively recent strata were depositeddirectly on top of very ancient ones.

{"question": "10 cc of battery acid (density 1.21) is diluted to 100 cc. 30 cc of the dilute solution is neutralized by 45 cc of 0.5 N base. What is the normality of the diluted acid? What is its strength in grams per liter? What is the strength of the undiluted 1.21 density acid in g/l?", "solution": "To solve this problem, use the following relationship for the neutralization of acids and bases N_aV_a = N_bV_b where N_a is the normality of the acid at volume V_a and N_b is the normality of the base at volume V_b. Thus, the normal-ity of the diluted acid is N_a = [(N_bV_b) / (V_a)] = {[(0.5 N) (0.045 l)] / [0.030 l]} = 0.75 N. Note: 1 cc = .001 l. The undiluted acid has a density of 1.21 g/cc; thus 10 cc of acid, weighs 12.1 g. Thus, when 90 cc of H_2O is added to form 100 cc of the diluted acid the weight of the entire solution becomes 90 + 12.1 = 102.1 g, but the weight of the acid is still 12.1 g. In a liter of diluted acid, there are {[(12.1 g) / (100cc)] \u00d7 [10 / 10]} = [(121.0 g) / (1000 cc)] = 121 g/l of acid. For the undiluted acid, the density is: {[(1.21 g) / (1 cc)] \u00d7 [1000 / 1000]} = [1210 g / 1000 cc] = 1210 g/l.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E26-0879.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "Normality of diluted acid: 0.75 N, Strength of diluted acid: 121 g/l, Strength of undiluted acid: 1210 g/l"}
{"question": "How much water must be added to 5 gallons of 90% ammonia solution to reduce the solution to a 60% solution?", "solution": "The volume of the original solution is 5 gallons. If we let x represent the number of gallons of water added to the original solution, then the final solution will have a volume of (5 + x) gallons. No ammonia is added so the only ammonia in the final solution is the ammonia in the original solution. We can now record our given information in tabular form: Volume Percent (Gallons) Percent Concentration Gallons of 100%Ammonia Original solution 5 90 4.5 Final solution 5 + x 60 4.5 Note: The gallons of 100% ammonia for the original solution was obtained in the following way: multiply the total volume of the original solution by the percent concentration of the original solution. Therefore, 5 \u00d7 90% =5\u00d7 (90/100_20) = (90/20) = (9/2) = 4.5 gallons of 100% ammonia. Also, the gallons of 100% ammonia for the final solution is the same as the gallons of 100% ammonia for the original solution; that is, 4.5 gallons, since no ammonia was added. The formula for the amount of substance in solution for the final solution is (total volume) \u00d7 (percent concentration) = gallons of 100% ammonia. Therefore: (5 + x) \u00d7 60%= 4.5 or(5 + x) (60/100)= 4.5 or(5 + x).60= 4.5 or.60 (5 + x)= 4.5 3 + .60x= 4.5 .6x= 4.5 - 3 .6x= 1.5 x= (1.5) / .6 = 2.5 gallons. Therefore, 2.5 gallons of water must be added to reduce the concentration to 60%. Check: If 2.5 gallons of water are added to the original solution, we will have 7.5 gallons of solution, The amount of 100% ammonia remains the same 4.5 gallons.

{"question": "A charge is placed on a string of infinite length so that the linear charge density on the string is n coulombs/m. Find the electric field due to this charge distribution.", "solution": "This problem can be solved using Gauss's Law. We construct as our Gaussian surface a cylinder, whose axis of symmetry coincides with the string, of length L, and of radius R. It can be seen from symmetry that there can be no component of the electric field parallel to the string, since all contributions to the field in that direction will cancel (see Fig. 2.). Since the field vector can be expressed in terms of components that are either perpendicular or parallel to the string, the resulting field will be radial. It can also be seen from symmetry that the magnitude of the field will be uniform over the surface of the cylinder, excluding the circular top and bottom. The flux through these portions is zero, however, since the field lines do not pass through their area. The flux through the cylinder is therefore: \\Phi_E = \\intE^\\ding{217} \\bullet dS^\\ding{217} = E \\int cos 0\\textdegree dS = E \\int dS = ES = E \\textbullet 2\\piRL Since the field is constant in magnitude it can be factored outside of the integral sign.

{"question": "Discuss the operation of (1) a voltmeter across a 12v. battery with an internal resistance r = 2\\Omega, (2) an ammeter in series with a 4\\Omega resistor connected to the terminals of the same battery.", "solution": "(1)Consider a source whose emf \\epsilon is constant and equal to 12 volts, and whose internal resistance r is 2 ohms. (The internal resistance of a commercial 12-volt lead storage battery is only a few thousandths of an ohm.) Figure 1 represents the source with a volt-meter V connected between its terminals a and b . A voltmeter reads the potential difference between its terminals. If it is of the conventional type, the voltmeter provides a conducting path between the terminals and so there is current in the source (and through the voltmeter). We shall assume, however, that the resistance of the volt-meter is so large (essentially infinite) that it draws no appreciable current. The source is then an open circuit, corresponding to a source with open terminals and the voltmeter reading V_ab equals the emf \\epsilon of the source, or 12 volts. (2)In Fig. 2, an ammeter A and a resistor of resistance R = 4\\Omega have been connected to the terminals of the source to form a closed circuit. The total resistance of the circuit is the sum of the re-sistance R, the internal resistance r, and the resistance of the ammeter. The ammeter resistance, however, can be made very small, and we shall assume it so small (essentially zero) that it can be neglected. The ammeter (whatever its resistance) reads the current I through it. The circuit corresponds to a source with a 4\\Omega resistance across its terminals. The wires connecting the resistor to the source and the ammeter, shown by straight lines, ideally have zero resistance and hence there is no potential difference between their ends. Thus points a and a' are at the same potential and are electrically equivalent, as are points b and b'. The potential differences V_ab , and V_a'b' . are therefore equal. The current I in the resistor (and hence at all points of the circuit) could be found from the relation I = V_ab /R, if the potential difference V_ab were known. However, V_ab is the terminal voltage of the source, equal to \\epsilon - Ir, and since this depends on I it is unknown at the start. We can, however, calculate the current from the circuit equa-tion: I = (\\epsilon/R + r) = [(12 volts)/(4\\Omega + 2\\Omega)] = 2 amp. The potential difference V_ab can now be found by considering a and b either as the terminals of the resistor or as those of the source.

{"question": "What are van der Waals forces? What is their significance in biological systems?", "solution": "Van der Waals forces are the weak attractive forces that molecules of non-polar compounds have for one another. These are the forces that allow non-polar compounds to liquefy and/or solidify. These forces are based on the existence of momentary dipoles within molecules of non- polar compounds. A dipole is the separation of opposite charges (positive and negative). A non-polar compound's average distribution of charge is symmetrical, so there is no net dipole. But, electrons are not static, they are constantly moving about. Thus, at any instant in time a small dipole will probably exist. This momentary dipole will affect the distri-bution of charge in nearby non-polar molecules, inducing charges in them. This induction happens because the negative end of the temporary dipole will repel electrons and the positive end attracts electrons. Thus, the neighboring non-polar molecules will have oppositely oriented dipoles: These momentary, induced dipoles are constantly changing, short range forces. But, their net result is attraction between molecules. The attraction due to van der Waals forces steadily increases when two non-bonded atoms are brought closer together reaching its maximum when they are just touching. Every atom has a van der Waals radius. The atoms are said to be touching when the distance between their nuclei is equal to the sum of their van der Waals radii. If the two atoms are then forced closer together, van der Walls attraction is replaced by van der Waals repulsion (the repulsion of the positively charged nuclei). The atoms then try to restore the state in which the distance be-tween their two nuclei equals the sum of their van der Waals radii. Both attractive and repulsive van der Waals forces play important roles in many biological systems. It is these forces, acting between non- polar chains of phospholipids, which serve as the cement holding together the membranes of living cells.", "images": ["images/F01-0016_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F01-0016.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Van der Waals forces are the weak attractive forces that molecules of non-polar compounds have for one another.

{"question": "The actual physical distances between linked genes bear no direct relationship to the map distances calculated on the basis of crossover percentages. Explain.", "solution": "In certain organisms, such asDrosophilia, the actual physical locations of genes can be observed. The chromosomes of the salivary gland cells in these insects have been found to duplicate themselves repeatedly without separating, giving rise to giant bundled chromo-somes, called polytenechromosomes. Such chromosomes show extreme magnification of any differences in density along their length, producing light and dark regions known as banding patterns. Each band on the chromosome has been shown by experiment to correspond to a single gene on the same chromosome. The physical location of genes determined by banding patterns gives rise to a physical map, giving absolute distances between genes on a chromosome. Since crossover percentage is theoretically directly proportional to the physical distance separating linked genes, we would expect a direct correspondence between physical distance and map distance. This, however , is not necessarily so. An important reason for this is the fact that the frequency of crossing over is not the same for all regions of the chromosome . Chromosome sections near thecentromereregions and elsewhere have been found to cross over with less frequency than other parts near the free end of the chromosome. In addition, mapping units determined from crossover percentages can be deceiving. Due to double crossing over (which results in a parental type ), the actual amount of crossover may be greater than that indicated by recombinant type percentages. However, crossover percentages are nevertheless invaluable because the linear order of the genes obtained is identical to that determined by physical mapping.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F25-0681.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The frequency of crossing over is not the same for all regions of the chromosome and due to double crossing over, the actual amount of crossover may be greater than that indicated by recombinant type percentages."}
{"question": "Design a computer program to playHexapawn. What is unusual about this program?", "solution": "Hexapawnis played on a 3 \u00d7 3 chess board. There are six pieces - three white pawns and three black pawns. The movements of the pawns are the same as in chess. The initial position is B B B W W W The object of the game is to get a passed pawn i.e. a pawn on the enemy's last rank. The first one to obtain a passed pawn (i.e. to place his pawn to any starting position of his opponent's pawns) wins. Alternatively, if no more moves are possible, (the position is totally blocked), then the person who made the last move is the winner. The squares are num-bered as follows: 123 456 789 The program forHexapawnis an application of cybernetics. The computer records every unfamiliar position in its memory including all the moves that follow. Now assume that the computer loses a game. It erases the move that led to de-feat. As an example: B Computer You W B W Here, with the computer to move, it could win by playing 6 to 9 (or even 1 to 5). However, if it plays 1 to 4 then you can win by moving 5 to 2. If this same position occurs in another game, the computer (assuming it played the losing move in the first game) will not even consider 1 to 4 but will play 6 to 9 or 1 to 5 instead. The computer has learn-ed from the first game. If the computer gets a position from which all moves have been deleted (they all led to defeat) it erases the move that got it there and resigns. In this way it saves only winning sequences of moves. If it plays long enough and encounters a great variety of unfamiliar positions it will become unbeatable.

The number of different positions in chess is of astronomical order and the chances of a computer encountering an exactly similar position twice are vanishingly small (apart from the openingand elementary end-game positions).

The flowchart can be started by the read statement, that is a command should be put into the computer to cause it to read the set of variables. To prevent an error a conditional statement should also be used immediately so that when there are no more variables to read the process will come to halt. A complete flowchart of the problem is given in fig. 1. It should be noted that each programmer has his or her own methods in programming. Therefore flowcharts also vary from person to person, depending on the method of approach to the problem. In the flowchart given, the programmer uses a set of conditional statements to find the largest commission and once it is found, the card or the group of variables is taken out of the deck and certain information contained in it is printed. Once the flowchart is done, the rest of the work is purely mechanical, and depends on the ability to use the technical knowledge related to the particular programming language, COBOL in this case.

{"question": "The faint light sometimes seen over Marshland at night, the \"will-o'-the-wisp\", is believed to come about as a result of the burning of a compound of phosphorus (P) and hydrogen (H) . What is the formula of this compound?", "solution": "To find the formula of this compound, it is necessary to determine the valence of the elements from which it is composed. The valence of an element is the number of electrons that are involved in chemical bonding. To find the valence of phosphorus and hydrogen, consider their atomic number and electronic configuration. Hydrogen: Atomic number= 1. Electronic configuration= 1s1 Phosphorus: Atomic number= 15. Electronic configuration= 1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^3. The outer electrons are 1s^1 for hydrogen, and 3p^3 for phosphorus. It takes one additional electron to fill hydrogen's s orbital; its valence is one. It takes 3 more electrons to fill phosphorus' p orbital; its valence is three. Elements react with the purpose of filling all their orbitals with the maximum number of electrons by either a transfer of electrons or by sharing electrons. It would take three hydrogen atoms to complete phosphorus' outer orbital. In turn, each electron of phosphorus would serve to complete the outer orbital of each hydrogen atom. This can be pictured in an electron-dot formula as shown above. In this figure, the X's represent the outer electrons of hydrogen and dots represent the electrons in the outer shell of phosphorus.

{"question": "What is the force due to the liquid only acting on a circular plate 2 in. in diameter which covers a hole in the bottom of a tank of oil 4 ft high, if the specific gravity of oil is .5?", "solution": "Since the liquid in the tank is in equilibrium, it can exert only a vertical force on the bottom of the tank, as shown in the figure. Furthermore, the net force on the bottom surface of the tank is due only to the weight of the water above this surface. Hence, F_net = Mg(1) where M is the mass of fluid in the tank. Since the density of the fluid is \\rho = M/V where V is the tank volume, we obtain M = \\rhoV andF_net = \\rhogV(2) The force on the circular plate of radius r is, using (2) F_plate = F_net (\\pir^2/A) = \\rhogV(\\pir^2/A)(3) where A is the area of the tank bottom.

{"question": "The heart is removed from the body and placed in an isosmotic solution. Although it is completely separated from nerves, it continues to beat. Explain.", "solution": "The initiation of the heartbeat and the beat itself are intrinsic properties of the heart and are not dependent upon stimulation from the central nervous system. The heart is stimulated by two sets of nerves (the sympathetic and vagus nerves), but these only partly regulate the rate of the beat, and are not responsible for the beat itself. The initiation of the heartbeat originates from a small strip of specialized muscle in the wall of the right atrium called the sino-atrial (S-A) node, which is also called the pacemaker of the heart. It is the S-A node which generates the rhythmic self-excitatory impulse, causing a wave of con-traction across the walls of the atria. (See figure). This wave of contraction reaches a second mass of nodal muscle called the atrio-ventricular node, or A-V node. The atrio-ventricular node is found in the lower part of the interatrial septum. As the wave of contraction reaches the A-V node, the wave stimulates the node, which produces an excitatory impulse. This impulse is rapidly transmitted to a bundle of nodal fibers called the A-V bundle or bundle of His. This bundle divides into right and left bundle bunches which ramify to the ventricular myocarium (the muscular layer of the heart wall) via the Purkinje fibers. The impulse is then transmitted to all parts of the ventricles causing them to contract as a unit. As the cardiac impulse travels from the S-A node through the atria, the wave of contraction forces blood through the valves and into the ventricles. (In the atria, the impulse is transmit-ted from cell to cell across the intercalated discs) . It is a \"wave\" of contraction because parts of the atria farthest from the S-A node contract later than do the parts closest to the node. The parts of the atria that contract first are also the first to relax, thus causing a wavelike motion upon contraction. Once the impulse reaches the A-V node, it is delayed (by a fraction of a second) before it is passed on to the ventricles. This transmission delay allows time for the atria to pump the blood into the ventricles before ventricular contraction begins. Unlike the atria, the ventricles contract as a unit. This is due to the rapid trans-mission of the impulse by the Purkinje fibers. For example, in the atria, the impulse travels at a velocity of .3 meter per second while in the Purkinje fibers, the impulse travels at about 2 meters per second. This allows almost immediate transmission of the impulse throughout the ventricular system. The adaptive significance of the contraction of the ventricles as a unit rather than as a wave is clear. The ventricles must exert as great a pressure as possible in order to force the blood throughout a long system of arteries, capillaries and veins. A greater pressure is more easily obtained if the ventricles con-tract as a unit, rather than in waves.", "images": ["images/F15-0376_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F15-0376.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The initiation of the heartbeat and the beat itself are intrinsic properties of the heart and are not dependent upon stimulation from the central nervous system."}

(d) What is the mechanical power developed?", "solution": "(a) As the armature rotates between the poles F and F' of the magnet (see figure 1), an emf is induced in the loops C. According to Lenz's Law, this emf will always be in opposition to the emf applied to run the motor. This induced emf is called the \"back emf\" since its polarity is opposite to that of the line voltage (the voltage which runs the motor. See Figure 2). Kirchoff's Voltage Law states that the sum of the voltage drops around a circuit loop must be zero. Using this law along with Ohm's Law, \\epsilon + IR - V_line = 0 Hence\\epsilon = V_line - IR = 120 V - (2\\Omega) (4A) = 112 V and opposesV_line , as shown in the diagram.

If the sheet is greasy, the contact angle is 180\\textdegree and the weight appears to be 3000 dynes. What is the surface tension of water?", "solution": "The contact angle \\texttheta is a measure of the curvature of the liquid surface adjacent to the metal sheet (see figure). In either case there are three forces acting on the sheet: the tension in the suspension which gives the apparent weight, the actual weight of the sheet, and the total surface- tension force. In the first case the angle of contact is zero and the surface tension force acts downward since it tries to restore the liquid to its original level. Thus since the sheet is in equilibrium F_1 = W + 2T, the factor 2 being necessary since thereare two sides to the sheet.

Explain why [CO] should be kept to a minimum.", "solution": "The concentration of carbon monoxide [CO] must be kept to a minimum due tohemoglobins' (Hb) greater affinity for CO than O_2 (oxygen). This occurs by the reaction HbO_2 + CO \\rightleftarrowsHbCO+ O_2. Because of this reaction in the presence of CO, less O_2 is available for body cells.

{"question": "What are the basic structural and functional differences between white blood cells and red blood cells? Describe two different ways that white blood cells act to protect the body from foreign agents such as microorganisms.", "solution": "In addition to red blood cells, human blood contains five types of white blood cells, or leukocytes. Unlike the red blood cells, all types of leukocytes contain nuclei and do not contain hemoglobin. Leukocytes are generally larger than erythrocytes and are far less numerous. There are approximately 5,400,000 red cells per cubic millimeter of blood in an adult male (4.6 million in females), while only about 7,000 leukocytes per cubic millimeter. There are five different types of leukocytes (see Figure). Leukocytes are classified as granular (eosino-phils, neutrophils and basophils) or angular (monocytes and lymphocytes). The granulocytes have granules in their cytoplasm, have lobed nuclei, and are produced in red bone marrow. The agranulocytes are produced in organs such as the lymph nodes, spleen and thymus. Neutrophils make up over 60% of the leukocytes present in the body. Like other leukocytes, they can squeeze through the pores of blood vessels and enter the tissue spaces. They then move by amoeboid movement to sites of infected tissue. For example, when bacteria enter a certain tissue of the body, they can either attack cells or produce damaging toxins. The blood vessels in the in-fected region dilate and allow more blood flow to the site, causing the heat and redness characteristic of inflammation. Blood vessel permeability also increases, causing fluid to enter the tissue and swelling to result. Neutrophils and monocytes pass through the blood vessels and engulf, ingest and destroy the bacteria. Foreign particles and dead tissue can also be engulfed by this process of phagocytosis. These leukocytes are chemically attracted to the inflamed site by products released from the damaged tissues. The monocytes (5.3%) usually appear after the neutro-phils and are more important in fighting chronic infections. Monocytes can phagocytize bacteria but more often, they en-large and become wandering macrophages, which can move more quickly and engulf more bacteria. Eosinophils (2.3%) are weakly phagocytic, and are involved in aller-gic reactions (by releasing antihistamines) and in fight-ing trichinosis (an infection caused by the parasitic worm, trichinella). Basophils ( .5%) liberate the anti-coagulant heparin which combats the coagulative pro cesses that sometimes occurs in prolonged inflammation. The second means by which leukocytes protect the body from invasion is carried out by the lymphocytes. Lymphocytes (30%) function in the process of immunity. Lymphocytes are involved in the production of anti-bodies, proteins made by the body in response to speci-fic foreign substances. These foreign substances are subsequently attacked and destroyed by the anitbodies. Immunity and its agents will be discussed in further questions. The main functions of the leukocytes are thus protective: phagocytosis and immunity. The major function of the erythrocytes is to carry hemoglobin for gaseous transport and exchange, which is essential to the continuation of cellular metabolic processes.", "images": ["images/F14-0358_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F14-0358.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "White blood cells contain nuclei and do not contain hemoglobin, they are larger and less numerous than red blood cells.

{"question": "At a carnival, the people who go on a certain ride sit in chairs around the rim of a horizontal circular plat-form which is oscillating rapidly with angular simple harmonic motion about a vertical axis through its center. The period of the motion is 2s and the ampli-tude .2 rad. One of the chairs becomes unbolted and just starts to slip when the angular displacement is a maximum. Calculate the coefficient of static friction between chair and platform. (The rim is 12 ft. from the center).", "solution": "In order to find the coefficient of static friction, we must use Newton's Second Law to relate the acceleration of the seat to the net force acting on it. Now, the platform and seat are oscillating about an axis through C (see figure (A)) with a maximum angular displacement \\texttheta_0. Since the motion is simple harmonic, we may write \\texttheta = \\texttheta_0 cos (\\omega_0t + \\rho)(1) which gives us the angular displacement of a point on the disc (and, hence, the seat) as a function of time. Note that \\rho is an arbitrary constant, which is determined by the way the angular motion begins, and \\omega_0 is the angular frequency of the motion. Differentiating (1) twice \\omega = d\\texttheta/dt = - \\texttheta_0 \\omega_0 sin (\\omega_0t + \\rho)(2) \\alpha = d\\omega/dt = - \\texttheta_0 \\omega0^2 cos (\\omega_0t + \\rho)(3) Here, \\omega and \\alpha are the angular velocity and acceleration of a point on the disc. Since the seat has an angular acceleration \\alpha, it also has a tangential acceleration a_t such that a_t = \\alphaR = - \\texttheta_0 \\omega0^2R cos (\\omega_0t + \\rho)(4) where R is the platform radius (and the distance of the seat from C, see figure (A)). In addition, the seat also has a radial acceleration, a_r pointing inward towards C. The value of a_r is a_r = \\omega^2 R = \\texttheta0^2 \\omega0^2R sin^2 (\\omega_0t + \\rho)(5) The net acceleration a is then a^2 = at^2 + ar^2 a^2 = \\texttheta_0 ^2 \\omega04R^2 cos^2 (\\omega_0t + \\rho) + \\texttheta0^4 \\omega0^2 R^2 sin^4 (\\omega_0t + \\rho) a^2 = \\texttheta_0^2 \\omega04R^2 [cos^2 (\\omega_0t + \\rho) + \\texttheta_0^2 sin^4 (\\omega_0t + \\rho)] ora = \\texttheta_0- \\omega_02R [cos^2 (\\omega_0t + \\rho) + \\texttheta_0^2 sin^4 (\\omega_0t + \\rho)]^1/2(6) If we assume the chair is unbolted, there are 2 sets of forces acting on the chair. In the vertical direction (perpendicular to the disc) 2 forces act - the normal force N of the disc on the chair, and its weight, mg (m is the chair's mass). Since the chair stays on the platform, there is no acceleration in the vertical direction, and N and mg balance: N = mg(7) In the plane of the disc, the only force acting is the force of static friction, f_s. By Newton's Second Law, this must equal the product of the chair's mass and acceleration. Using (6) f_s = m \\texttheta_0 \\omega0^2 R [cos^2 (\\omega_0t + \\rho) + \\texttheta0^2 sin^4 (\\omega_0t + \\rho)^1/2] Butf_s \\leq u_s N Hence,f_s \\leq u_s mg Combining the first, and last equation for f_s, m \\texttheta_0 \\omega02R [cos^2 (\\omega_0t + \\rho) + \\texttheta0^2 sin^4 (\\omega_0t + \\rho)]^1/2 \\leq u_s mg Solving for u_s u_s \\geq [(\\texttheta_0 \\omega0^2 R)/g] [ cos^2 (\\omega_0t + \\rho) + \\texttheta0^2 sin^4 (\\omega_0t + \\rho)]^1/2(8) This relation holds as long as the seat is stationary. Once the seat begins to slip, the maximum force of static friction is encountered, and (8) becomes a strict equality: u_s = (\\texttheta_0 \\omega0^2 R/g)[ cos^2 (\\omega_0t + \\rho) + \\texttheta_0^2 sin^4 (\\omega_0t + \\rho)]^1/2(9) Note that slippage occurs at the maximum value of \\texttheta, or \\texttheta_0.For this value of \\texttheta, (1) yields \\texttheta_0 = \\texttheta_0 cos (\\omega_-0t + \\alpha) whencecos (\\omega_-0t + \\alpha)= 1 As a result,sin (\\omega_-0t + \\alpha)= 0 Using these facts in (9) u_s = [(\\texttheta_0 \\omega0^2 R)/g](1 + 0)^1/2 = (\\texttheta_0 \\omega0^2 R)/g(10) Note that we don't know \\omega_0, but we do know T, the period of the oscillation.

{"question": "A thin lens of long focal length is supported horizontal-ly short distance above the flat polished end of a steel cylinder. The cylinder is 5 cm high and its lower end is rigidly held. Newton's rings are produced between the lens and the upper end of the cylinder, using normal-ly incident light of wavelength 6000\\textdegreeA, and viewed from above by means of a microscope. When the temperature of the cylinder is raised 25 C deg, 50 rings move past the cross-wires of the microscope. What is the coefficient of linear expansion of steel.", "solution": "Initially, the cylinder has a length d, and a gap of length t_0 exists between the top of the cylinder and the bottom surface of the lens in the portion of the air wedge viewed in the microscope at the same position as the cross-wires. (Technically, t_0 is the distance of the lens from the cylinder as measured along axis AA' in figure (B). However, since the lens is thin, t_0 is the distance of any point on the bottom surface of the lens from the top of the cylinder). Let us now see how interference fringes are produced. Light is incident upon the lens from above. Light is transmitted through both lens surfaces with no phase change. However, the light reflected from the bottom lens surface and the top of the cylinder are 180\\textdegree (or \\lambda/2) out of phase. This phase change is due to the reflection from the cylinder. In addition, the wave reflected from the cylinder travels a distance 2t_0greater than the ray reflected from the lens in tra-versing the air gap. If this distance is equal to an odd number of half-wavelengths (odd because the waves are already \\lambda/2 out of phase due to reflection) con-structive interference will occur.

(d) From the calculations in (b) and (c) does it appear likely that a neutron could be made up of an electron and a proton?", "solution": "(a) The uncertainty principle states that\\Deltap\\Deltax\\cong (h/4\\pi) , where h is Planck's constant,\\Deltapis the un-certainty of the momentum of a particle, and\\Deltaxis the un-certainty in the position of the particle. If we assume that the electron can be found anywhere within the neutron, then\\Deltaxwill be of the order of the neutron radius 10^-15 m. p can then be found using the uncertainty prin-ciple . \\Deltap= (h/4\\pi\\Deltax) = [(6.63 \u00d7 10^-34 Joule-sec)/(4\\pi 10^-15 m)] = 5.28 \u00d7 10^-20 kg-m/sec (b) We must find a relation between energy E and momentum p. Since E = mc^2 = [m_0/\\surd{1 - (v^2/c^2)}]^c(2) where m_0 is the rest mass of the electron, and v its speed, we have, upon squaring both sides of the equation, E^2[1 - (v^2/c^2)] = (m_0 c^2)^2 E^2 = [(E^2 v^2)/c^2] + (m_0 c^2)^2 = (E^2/c^4)c^2v^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2 = [(m^2 c^2)/c^4]c^2 v^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2 E^2 = p^2 c^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2.(1) Here, we used the definition of momentum as p =mv. We have m_0 = 9.11 \u00d7 10^-31 kg, c = 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/sec and p = (\\Deltap/2) = [(5.28 \u00d7 10^-20)/2] (km/sec) = 2.64 \u00d7 10^-20 (km/sec).

{"question": "Although it is often possible to see unicellular organisms if a dropof pond water is placed on a microscope slide, it is impossibleto seecuboidalepithelium if a rat kidney is placedunder the microscope. Describe the steps necessary forthe preparation of tissues for light microscopy.", "solution": "There are four basic steps in the preparation of tissues for light microscopy. (1) Fixing. The tissue is killed and stabilized with chemical agents, sothat structures are preserved with a life-like appearance. Fixing preventspost-mortem changes of tissue structure caused by autolysis (self--digestion) . (2) Embedding. The fixed tissue is embedded in a hard material thatprovides firm support. This material is often paraffin or wax. The tissueis dehydrated and soaked in molten wax which penetrates the tissuesand then is cooled to form a hard matrix. (3) Sectioning. The support provided by the em-bedding material enablesthe tissue to be cut into very thin slices without being crushed by theknife edge. Sectioning tissue permits study of complex structures by providingan unimpeded view of deep layers. (4) Staining. The cells are stained with dyes that color only certain organelles. This provides contrast between different cellular structures, for example, be-tween nucleus and cytoplasm or between mitochondria and othercytoplasmicstructures. Most cellular structures are colorless. If unstained, it is difficult and often impossible to distinguish different cellular regionsby light microscopy. Cytochemistryrefers to staining procedures which specifically color certaincellular substances. For ex-ample, theFeulgenprocedure specificallydyes DNA. DNA reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to give aldehydegroups; these then react with the colorless Schiff reagent to changethe dye to red. No other cellular components react in the right way withHClto cause the Schiff re-agent to become colored, so only DNA is stained.

These two classes of annelids are adapted to live different lifestyles. Earthworms live in a moist terrestrial habitat. They are commonly seen burrowing through damp soil.Nereis, like manypolychaetesare marine worms which swim freely in the sea. Often they are found burrowing in sand and mud near the shore, or living in tubes formed by secretions from their body wall. The obvious difference in lifestyles between the two worms, the earthworm being a soil burrower,Nereis being a free swimmer, will be important in analyzing their adaptive body structures. The earthworm has four pairs of bristles or chaetae (also spelled setae) on each body segment except the first. These bristles enable the earthworm to grasp the ground or adhere to the walls of its burrow while in motion.Nereisalso has chaetae which cover the paired paddles or parapodia , which appear on each of their body segments. Theparapodia are the structures which giveNereisthe ability to swim. Adaptations are also apparent in the methods of nutrient procurement in the different habitats of the earthworm andNereis. Earthworms feed on decomposing matter as they sweep along the ground. The anterior segment bears no special appendages. In contrast, Nereis is a predator and the anterior end of the body commonly bears tentacles, bristles,palps, and antennae. The earthworm, living a subterranean life, has no well-developed sense organs.Nereis, an active swimmer, has two pairs of eyes, and organs sensitive to touch and to chemicals in the water. Fertilization is external in both the earthworm andNereis. However, Nereis , which relies on a watery medium for the union of egg and sperm, has no special protective device for the developing young.

{"question": "Explain the mechanism of the genetic determination of sex in man .", "solution": "The sex chromosomes are an exception to the general rule that the members of a pair of chromosomes are identical in size and shape and carry allelic pairs. The sex chromosomes are not homologous chromosomes . In man, the cells of females contain two identicalsex chromosomes or X chromosomes. In males there is only one X chromosome and a smaller Y chromosome with which the X pairs during meiotic synapsis. Men have 22 pairs of ordinary chromosomes (autosomes), plus one X and one Y chromosome, and women have 22 pairs ofautosomesplus two X chromosomes. Thus it is the presence of the Y chromosome which determines that an individual will be male. Although the mechanism is quite complex, we know that the presence of the Y chromosome stimulates thegonadal medulla , or sex-organ forming portion of the egg; to develop into male gonads , or sex-organs. In theabscenceof the Y chromosome, and in the presence of two X chromo-somes, the medulla develops into female gametes . [Note, that a full complement of two X chromosomes are needed for normal female development.] In man, since the male has one X and one Y chromosome, two types of sperm, or male gametes, are produced during spermatogenesis (theprocess of sperm formation, which includes meiosis) One half of the sperm population contains an X chromosome and the other half contains a Y chromosome. Each egg, or female gamete, contains a single X chromosome . This is because a female has only X chromo-somes, and meiosis produces only gametes with X chromo-somes. Fertilization of the X-bearing egg by an X-bearing sperm results in an XX, or female offspring . The ferti-lization of an X-bearing egg byaY-bearing sperm results in an XY, or male offspring.

{"question": "The principle of negative feedback, where an increase in the output of a system acts on the system to halt its further production, is manifested in the menstrual cycle. Where?", "solution": "The first event in a menstrual cycle following the menstrual phase (flow phase) is an increase in the secretion of FSH by the anterior pituitary as a result of stimulation by the hypothalamus. This hormone stimulates the development of the follicles in the ovaries, which contain the eggs. After some time, one of the follicle gains predominance. At this point, only this one follicle continues to grow. Under the combined influence of both FSH and LH, the latter of which is maintained, at a low level in the blood by the follicular cells, the cells surrounding the egg within the follicle begin to secrete estrogen. As more and more estrogen is produced, the increased level of this hormone in the blood exerts an inhibitory effect on the FSH-stimulating center in the hypothalamus. This results in a decrease in the level of FSH produced by the anterior pituitary. This is the negative feedback mechanism between estrogen and FSH. High concentration of a secreted substance (estrogen) turns off the original stimulus for its production (FSH), so that an excessive amount of the secreted substance (estrogen) would not be made. This occurs roughly 8 to 10 days following the menstrual phase, or 13 to 15 days after the start of the cycle. While the high level of estrogen inhibits FSH production, it activates the LH-stimulating center in the hypothalamus, ultimately inducing a surge of LH into the circulatory system, which initiates ovulation. After ovulation the ovarian follicle with the egg discharged develops into the progesterone-secreting corpus luteum. The corpus luteum promotes the plasma progesterone level to such a state that progesterone begins to exert ah inhibitory effect on the LH-stimulating center in the hypothalamus. This is the negative feed-back mechanism between progesterone and LH. The high progesterone concentration suppresses further release of LH so that another ovulation is prevented; hence no other corupus luteum is formed to contribute more progesterone to the circulatory system.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F21-0557.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The negative feedback mechanism is manifested in the menstrual cycle between estrogen and FSH, and between progesterone and LH."}

Rewriting r_2^\\ding{217} = (1/m_2)[{Gm_1m_2(r_1^\\ding{217} - r_2^\\ding{217})} / {\\vertr_1^\\ding{217} - r_2^\\ding{217}\\vert^3} ](3) r_1^\\ding{217} = -(1/m_1)[{Gm_1m_2(r_1^\\ding{217} - r_2^\\ding{217})} / {\\vertr_1^\\ding{217} - r_2^\\ding{217}\\vert^3}](4) Subtracting (3) from (4), and using the figure to realize that r_1^\\ding{217} - r_2^\\ding{217} = r^\\ding{217}, we obtain r_1^\\ding{217} - r_2^\\ding{217} = r^\\ding{217}= -(1/m_1) [(Gm_1m_2r^\\ding{217})/(r^3)] - (1/m_2) [(Gm_1m_2r^\\ding{217})/(r^3)] or r^\\ding{217} = -[(Gm_1m_2r^\\ding{217})/(r^3)] [(1/m_1) + (1/m_2)] Defining the reduced mass \\mu as 1/\\mu = (1/m_1) + (1/m_2)(5) we find \\mur^\\ding{217} = -[(Gm_1m_2r^\\ding{217})/(r^3)](6) This equation is a one body equation describing the motion of a particle of mass \\mu under the influence of a gravitational force. Now, to further reduce the problem, assume that each mass shown in the figure rotates in a circular orbit with the given angular velocities about Q, the center of mass. Using Newton's Second Law for each mass, (m_1v \u05f3 1 2 )/(r \u05f3 1 ) = (Gm_1m_2)/(r^2)(7) (m_1v_2 \u05f3 2 )/(r_2 \u05f3 ) = (Gm_1m_2)/(r^2)(8) where the primed variables are measured with respect to the point Q. By definition of the center of mass m_1r_1 \u05f3 \\ding{217} + m_2r_2 \u05f3 \\ding{217} = 0 orr_1 \u05f3 \\ding{217} = -(m_2r_2 \u05f3 \\ding{217} )/(m_1)(9) Furthermore,r\\ding{217}= r_1 \u05f3 \\ding{217} - r_2 \u05f3 \\ding{217} orr_2 \u05f3 \\ding{217} = r_1 \u05f3 \\ding{217} - r^\\ding{217}(10) Inserting (10) in (9), and solving for r_1 \u05f3 \\ding{217} r_1 \u05f3 \\ding{217} = - [(m_2)/(m_1)] r_2 \u05f3 \\ding{217} = -[(m_2)/(m_1)]( r_1 \u05f3 \\ding{217} - r^\\ding{217}) r_1 \u05f3 \\ding{217} [1 + (m_2)/(m_1)] = [(m_2)/(m_1)] r^\\ding{217} r_1 \u05f3 \\ding{217} = [m_2/m_1r^\\ding{217}] / [1 + (m_2)/(m_1)] = [m_2r^\\ding{217}] / [m_1 + m_2](11) But using (5) \\mu = (m_1m_2)/(m_1 + m_2) Hence, (9) becomes r_1 \u05f3 \\ding{217} = (\\mu/m_1) r^\\ding{217}(12) Similarly,r_2 \u05f3 \\ding{217} = -(\\mu/m_2) r^\\ding{217}(13) Hencer_1 \u05f3 \\ding{217} = (\\mu/m_1) r r_2 \u05f3 \\ding{217} = (\\mu/m_2) r(14) Using (14) in (7) and (8) (m^2_1v_1 \u05f3 2 )/\\mur = (Gm_1m_2)/(r^2) (m^2_2v_2 \u05f3 2 )/\\mur = (Gm_1m_2)/(r^2) or(m_1v_1 \u05f3 2 )/2= (\\muGm_2)/(2r) (m_2v_2 \u05f3 2 )/2= (\\muGm_1)/(2r) Therefore, the net kinetic energy of the system relative to the center of the mass is T = (1/2) m_iv_1 \u05f3 2 + (1/2) m_2v_2 \u05f3 2 = [(\\muG)/(2r)] (m_1+ m_2)(15) T = (Gm_1m_2)/(2r)(16) by definition of \\mu. The total energy is E = T + V = (Gm_1m_2)/(2r) - (Gm_1m_2)/(r) E = - [(Gm_1m_2)/(r)](17) To remove the variable r, we replace it with the angular momentum J^\\ding{217} as follows. The total system angular momentum is (relative to Q) J^\\ding{217} = r_1 \u05f3 \\ding{217} \u00d7 m_1v_1 \u05f3 \\ding{217} + r_2 \u05f3 \\ding{217} \u00d7 m_2v_2 \u05f3 \\ding{217} Since r_1'^\\ding{217} and v_i'^\\ding{217} are perpendicular, and similarly for r_2 \u05f3 \\ding{217} and v_2'^\\ding{217}, we obtain J = m_1r_1 \u05f3 v_1 \u05f3 + m_2r_2 \u05f3 v_2 \u05f3 (18) From (12) and (13) v_1'^\\ding{217} = (\\mu/m_1) v^\\ding{217}r_1'^\\ding{217} = (\\mu/m_1) r^\\ding{217} v_2'^\\ding{217} = -(\\mu/m_2) v^\\ding{217}r_2'^\\ding{217} = -(\\mu/m_2) r^\\ding{217} orv_1' = (\\mu/m_1) v^\\ding{217}r_1'= (\\mu/m_1) r^\\ding{217} v_2' = -(\\mu/m_2) v^\\ding{217}r_2'= -(\\mu/m_2) r^\\ding{217}(19) using (19) in (18) J = (m_1)[(\\mu/m_1) r] [(\\mu/m_1) v] + (m_2)[(\\mu/m_2) r] [(\\mu/m_2) v] J = (\\mu^2/m_1) vr + (\\mu^2/m_2) vr = \\mu^2 vr[(1/(m_1) + (1/m_2)] By definition of \\mu J = \\muvr(20) We now eliminate v in (20) so that we may sub-stitute (20) in place of r in (17).

We must then substitute into the formula V = nRT/P = (N/A) (RT/P) in order to obtain the volume corresponding to N molecules. In the second part of this problem we can use V = nRT/P directly, remembering that 1 millimole = 10^-3 mole.

We must find the number of moles, n, of gaseous products. The number of moles of nitroglycerin we started with is equal to its mass divided by the molecular weight, or 454 g/227 g/mole = 2 moles of nitroglycerin. Dividing the equation for the reaction of nitroglycerin by 2 (so that 4C_3 H_5 (NO_3)_3 becomes 2C_3 H_5 (NO_3) _3), we obtain: 2C_3 H_5 (NO_3)_3 (l) \\rightarrow 6CO_2 (g) + 3N_2 (g) + (1/2)O_2 (g) + 5H_2 O (g).

{"question": "A ball is thrown upward with an initial velocity of 32 ft/sec from the top of a building. Calculate the velocity and the position as functions of the time.", "solution": "The only force acting on the ball is the grav-itational force, which is directed downward, throughout its motion, therefore, the ball will be accelerated downward, at a = - g = - 32 ft/sec^2. We have chosen the positive direction to be up. We have two directions of motion to consider: first, the upward motion to the max-imum height and then the downward motion toward the ground. Therefore, we must be careful to use the proper signs in our equations. We choose the origin for distance (y=0) at the point from which the ball is thrown. The initial velocity of the ball is v_0 = +32 ft/sec. The ball grad-ually loses velocity until it reaches its maximum height. Then it falls down towards the ground.

{"question": "Write a FORTRAN program that accepts two positive integers and out-puts a message indicating whether the integers between the two limits are perfect, abundant, or deficient.", "solution": "The proper divisors of a positive integer include all divisors except the integer itself. For instance, the proper divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4, and 6. We use three terms to classify integers according to the sums of their divisors. An integer is perfect if the sum of its proper divisors is equal to that integer. There exist only 6 perfect numbers less than 10 billion, all of which are even. One of them is integer 6. Its proper divisors are 1,2 and 3, the sum of which is equal to 1 + 2 + 3= 6. The rest of the integers may be either abundant or deficient. An integer is abundant if the sum of its proper divisors is greater than that integer. Conversely, an integer is deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than an integer itself. Perfect numbers are related toMersenneprimes, which take the form 2^K -1. We can say that if 2^K - 1 is prime, then n = 2^K - 1(2K - 1) is perfect. Note that we refer only to even perfect numbers. No odd perfect numbers have yet been demonstrated. The program uses a subprogram called NSIGMA, named for the \\sigma-function. If q is a prime, then\\sigma(q) = q + 1. In general, \\sigma \\sigma \\sigma \\sigma(q)^K = [(q^K+1 -1) / (q -1)] for q = 1, 2, 3,... \\sigma \\sigma An array, NPRIM, is used to store all primes between 2 and 181. Although this example uses a DATA statement for the primes, you could also use a subprogram for the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate primes. The main program reads in upper and lower bounds (HI and LO, respectively), an increment term (I), and a case number (K), which indicates the following according to the values assigned to it: K = -2 output deficient numbers only K = -1 output deficient and perfect numbers only K = 0 output all numbers K = 1 output abundant and perfect numbers only K = 2 output abundant numbers only Since the highest prime number stored in NPRIM is 181, the upper bound cannot exceed (181)2 = 32761, otherwise some of the divisors may end up missing.

{"question": "A man with diabetes mellitus has a sudden fit of anger over a minor traffic accident, and lapses into a coma. Explain the physiological events leading to the coma and what should be done to bring him out of the coma.", "solution": "Diabetes mellitus is a disease which results from a hyposecretion of insulin. Insulin stimulates glu-cose uptake by all cells with the exception of brain cells. Hyposecretion of insulin reduces the cellular uptake of glucose, leading to an accumulation of glucose in the blood. The blood glucose may rise to such a level that a good deal of it cannot be reabsorbed by the kidney tubules. When this happens the level of glucose excreted into the urine increases tremendously. The osmotic force exerted by glucose in the urine retains water and prevents its reabsorption. Thus, the volume of water excreted is also abnormally high in people with diabetes. This loss of wa-ter, if sufficiently great, can ultimately reduce blood pres-sure to such an extent that there is a marked decrease in blood flow to the brain, resulting in coma and possibly death. In our specific example, coma is induced by the afore-mentioned means. Emotional stress stimulates the release of glucose from the liver through the action of epinephrine, thereby resulting in a rapid increase in blood glucose.In the case of a person with diabetes, this increased blood glucose results in a large amount of water loss, which in turn leads to a decreased blood pressure. Blood flow to the brain is reduced owing to the drop in blood pressure. Coma usually results as blood supply to the brain cells becomes insufficient. Insulin should be given as treatment for this comatose person. Insulin will stimulate glucose uptake, thereby reducing its level in the blood. Glucose concentration in the urine subsequently declines, and water loss is diminished. The pressure of the blood is thereby restored to normal. It is important to note that the dosage of insulin injected is critical. If an overdose of insulin is ad-ministered, the situation is equally fatal had no insulin been injected. This is because insulin cannot enter the brain, and hence the brain cells will not alter their rate of glucose uptake. Thus they are greatly dependent on the blood supply for glucose to maintain their energy metabolism. When too much insulin is given to the diabetic, his blood stream is essentially depleted of glucose units which have entered most of the body cells excepting the brain cells. Hence the brain will starve from an insuffi-cient supply of glucose, and its functions will break down. A coma is usually what follows.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F21-0537.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Insulin should be given as treatment for this comatose person."}
{"question": "In Drosophilia, the dominant gene G codes for gray body color and the dominant gene N codes for normal wings. The recessive alleles of these two genes result in black body color (g) and vestigial wings (n) respectively. Flies homozygous for gray body and normal wings were crossed with flies that had black bodies and vestigial wings. The F_1 progeny were then test-crossed, with the following results: Gray body, normal wings236 Black body, vestigial wings253 Gray body, vestigial wings50 Black body, normal wing61 Would you say that these two genes are linked?If so, how many map units apart are they on the chromosomes?", "solution": "To determine if the two genes are linked, we look at the F_2 progeny. We notice that there are, two large groups (236, 253) which are approximately equal, and two small groups (50, 61) which are also nearly equal. We can reduce these numbers to small whole number ratios: gray body,normal wings236/50 roughly equals5 black body,vestigial wings253/50 roughly equals5 gray body,vestigial wings61/50 roughly equals1 black body,normal wings50/50 roughly equals1 Since the heterozygous F_2 parent (the result of a cross from two homozygous parents) is crossed with a double recessive, we would expect a 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 phenotypic ratio among the offspring (see previous problem). However, the ratio here is 5 : 5 : 1 : 1. This significant departure from the 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 ratio indicates that linkage is indeed likely. The fact that the ratio divides the progeny into four groups, two large and of equal size and two small and of equal size, is also a typical result of a cross involving linked genes. To calculate the distance between the genes, we will have to rely on the fact that the frequency of crossing over depends on this distance. It is logical to assume that the farther apart two genes are on a chromosome, the more likely it is that a crossover will occur, because there is a larger possible region in which it can occur. The process of locating genes on chromosomes is called mapping. The percentage of crossing over or recombination gives us no information about the absolute distances between the genes but it does give us relative distances between them. Suppose, for example, that genes A and B have a recombination frequency of 20% and genes A and C have a frequency of 40%. From this data, we cannot tell the exact distance of B from A or C from A but we can say that C must be twice as far from A as B is from A, since twice as much crossing over occurred in the distance between C and A. Instead of having to compare two distances every time we want to refer to the separation of two genes, we have, by convention, established a standard measurement known as a map unit. A map unit is defined as the distance on the chromosome within which a crossover occurs one percent of the time. When genes on a chromosome are allocated their respective positions on that chromosome, we can obtain what we call a genetic map. To obtain the map distance between two genes, we have to know the frequency of crossing over between them. Recombination frequency is defined as the ratio of the number of recombinants to the whole progeny, that is, Because recombinants can only result from a cross-over event, their numbers in the population will be small for closely linked genes. The recombinants in this problem are found in the two smaller groups, and their total is 50 + 61 or 111. The total number of progeny is 236 + 253 + 50 + 61 or 600. Therefore: RF= [(number of recombinants) / (total number of progeny)] = [(111) / (600)] = 0.185. Since the map units are expressed as a percentage of recombination, a RF of 0.185 is the same as 0.185 \u00d7 100 or 18.5 map units. Hence a map distance of 18.5 map units separates the gene for body color from the gene for wing size (See Fig.)", "images": ["images/F25-0673_files/image002.jpg", "images/F25-0673_files/image004.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F25-0673.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "18.5 map units"}

{"question": "What is a fruit? What roles do fruits play in the dispersion of the seeds?", "solution": "The ovary of an angiosperm is the basal part of the pistil. The ovary contains the ovules which will become the seeds after fertilization. Concomitant with the development of the zygote into an embryo, the ovary enlarges to form the fruit. A fruit therefore can be defined as a matured ovary, containing the matured ovules. A true fruit is one developed solely from the ovary. An accessory fruit is one developed from sepals, petals, or the receptacle as well as the ovary. The apple, for example, is mostly an enlarged receptacle; only the core is derived from the ovary. All angiosperms have fruits, either true or accessory. This characteristic makes them unique among living things. Fruits represent an adaptation for the dispersal of the seeds by various means, and they may be classified according to this criterion as wind-borne fruits, water-borne fruits, or animal-borne fruits. Wind-borne fruits are light and dry so that they can easily be carried by wind. In the tumbleweeds, the whole plant, or fruiting structure, is blown by the wind and scatters seeds as it goes. Other wind-borne fruits, such as the maple, have evolved wing - like structures. Still others, such as the dandelion, develop aplumelike pappuswhich keeps the light fruits aloft. Water-borne fruits are adapted for floating, either because air is trapped in some part of the fruit, or because the fruit contains corky tissue. The coconut fruit has an outer coat especially adapted for carriage by ocean currents. Rain is another means of fruit dispersal by water, and is particularly important for plants living on hillsides or mountain slopes. Animal-borne fruits are mostly fleshy. This makes them appetizing to vertebrates. When fleshy fruits ripen, they undergo a series of characteristic changes, mediated by the hormone ethylene. Among these are a rise in sugar content, a general softening of the fruit through the breakdown ofpecticsubstances, and often a change in color to conspicuous bright red, yellow, blue, or black. When such fruits are eaten by birds or animals, they spread the seeds that lie within-them either passing them unharmed through their digestive tracts or carrying them as adherent passengers on their fur or feathers. Some fruits are further equipped with prickles, hooks, hairs, or sticky coverings, and so can be transported for long distances by animals. The modifications of seeds for dispersal by animals illustrate an evolutionary adaptation to the coexistence of plant and animal forms.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F08-0200.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "A fruit can be defined as a matured ovary, containing the matured ovules.

{"question": "What is the maximum speed at which a car can safely round a circular curve of radius 160 ft on a horizontal road if the coefficient of static friction between tires and road is 0.8? The width between the wheels is 5 ft and the center of gravity of the car is 2 ft above the road. Will the car overturn or skid if it just exceeds this speed?", "solution": "The magnitude of the maximum frictional force that can be brought into play between tires and road is F = \\muN, where N^\\ding{217} is the normal force exerted by the road on the car and \\mu is the coefficient of static friction. But, since there is no upward movement of the car, N^\\ding{217} just balances the third force acting on the car, the weight mg^\\ding{217}. Hence F = \\mumg. This must provide the centripetal force necessary to keep the car in the curve of radius r when it is moving with the maximum permissible speed v. Hence, \\mumg = mv^2/r v = \\surd(\\murg) = \\surd(0.8 \u00d7 160 ft \u00d7 32 ft \\bullet s^-2) v = 65 ft \\bullet s^-1. The frictional force F^\\ding{217} acts in the plane of the road surface and not through the center of mass of the car. In addition to providing the centripetal force necessary to keep the car in the curve, the frictional force must therefore produce a rotational motion about the center of mass. The only point of contact between car and road will then be at O in the diagram. Therefore, N^\\ding{217} must act through this point; but the weight of the car of magnitude mg = N still acts through the center of gravity. These two parallel but displaced forces form a couple of positive moment, tending to restore all car wheels to the road and to prevent the overturning. The moment of the frictional force is -\\muN = - mv^2/r multiplied by the height of the center of mass above the road. Thus M_1 = -\\muN \u00d7 2 ft = -\\mumg \u00d7 2 ft. Assuming that the center of gravity of the car is centrally located, the moment of normal force is N = mg, multiplied by half the width between the wheels.

The restoring moment is therefore greater than the overturning moment at the maximum speed. If this speed is just exceeded, the car does not overturn. It skids, since the centripetal force is not now great enough to provide the acceleration necessary to keep it going round the curve, and the overturning moment is less than the restoring moment.", "images": ["images/D04-0168_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Physics/D04-0168.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "The car skids"}

It also summarizes the weight composition of the substance. Hence, to calculate such a formula, the molecular weight, the weight composition of the substance, and the atomic weights of the constituent elements must be known. The weight composition of the substances in nicotine, assuming there are 100 g of it, are C = 74.0 g, H = 8.7 g, N = (110 - 74.0 - 8.7) = 17.3 g.

{"question": "Name the two basic classes of electronic computers. Give the basic similarities and differences between them.", "solution": "The two main classes of electronic computers are analog and digital, although analog computers are seldom used these days. The analog computers use continuous electrical quan-tities such as voltages, currents, capacitances, etc. to repre-sent the continuous real-world quantities such as temperature, pressure, mass, and so on. For example, 1 + 1 = 2 may be repre-sented as 1 volt + 1 volt = 2 volts using appropriate circuitry. On the other hand, a more complicated mechanical system shown in Figure 1-2a may be represented by the electrical circuit shown in Figure 1 - 2b. Figure 1-2. Representation of A Problem by Analog Computer. The general equation of oscillation for the mechanical system is given by: {MD + F + (1 / KD)} X = 0, where D is called the differential operator, and X is the posi-tion of the weight at any moment. After the switch is closed, the equation of the electrical oscillation will take the form: {LD + R (1 / CD)} I = 0, where D is same as before, and I is the current at any moment. Note that these two equations are identical, except for some of the letters used. Therefore, the behavior of the two systems will be identical. Although analog computers are good in solving problems that involve continuous quantities, the representation is not always easy and the accuracy is in doubt. For example, an analog com-puter calculates the interest on a million-dollar loan, the result could be off by at least a few dollars. The accountant who must reckon every penny may not be satisfied with that kind of result. The digital computer deals with numbers represented inter-nally as a sequence of binary digits (or bits). The architecture and operation of these systems are detailed throughout this chapter. Although a digital computer cannot directly represent and solve the above problem whose nature is continuous, it can be programmed to solve the problem through a mathematical proce-dure. Moreover, the results will be as accurate as the math-ematical formulation allows. In the case of interest calcula-tions on a million-dollar loan, the result will be accurate down to the pennies, except for possible round-off error that is really the property of mathematical solution procedure and not the fault of the digital computer. The digital computers have advantages of programmability with reliable accuracy, since exactly the same result will be obtained the next time the program is executed. The analog com-puter may sometimes have advantage in solving continuous type problems in a direct way to produce results that are not precise but acceptable for all practical purposes. The similarity be-tween the two classes of computers is the fact that both are electromechanical machines. The difference is that the digital computers, sometimes at the expense of extra storage and fre-quency bandwidths (e.g. more complex electronic signals), are more reliable and accurate.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G01-0006.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Analog and digital"}

{"question": "Why is it that alveolar air differs in its composition from atmospheric air? Of what significance is this fact?", "solution": "The respiratory tract is composed of conduct-ing airways and the alveoli. Gas exchange occurs only in the alveoli and not in the conducting airways. The maximum alveolar volume is about 500 ml. Let us consider then what takes place during expiration. Five hundred milliliters of air is forced out of the alveoli, and into the conducting airways of the respiratory tract. Of this air, 150 ml. remains in the respiratory airways following expiration, while 350 ml. of air is exhaled from the body. During the next inspiration 500 ml. of air are taken up by the alveoli, but 150 ml. of this air is not atmospheric, but rather is the air that remained in the tubes following the previous expiration. One can see, then, that only 350 ml. of fresh atmospheric air enters the alveoli during each inspiration. At the end of inspiration, 150 ml. of fresh air also fills the airways but does not reach the alveoli. Hence no gas exchange between this air and the blood can occur. This fresh air will be expelled from the body during the next expiration, and will be replaced again with 150 ml. of alveolar air, thus completing the cycle. From this cycle it can be seen that of the 500 ml. of air entering the body during inspiration, 150 ml. of it never reaches the alveoli, but instead remains in the con-ducting tubes of the respiratory system. The term \"anatomical dead space\" is given to the space within the conducting tubes because no gas exchange with the blood can take place there. The question arises then, as to the significance of this dead space. Because the tubes are not completely emptied and filled with each breath, \"new\" air can mix with \"old\" air. Consequently, alveolar air contains less oxygen and more carbon dioxide than atmospheric air. In addition, the air that remains in the alveoli following expiration (the residual volume) can, to a limited extent, mix with the incoming air and thereby alter its composition.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F16-0396.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Alveolar air contains less oxygen and more carbon dioxide than atmospheric air because the tubes are not completely emptied and filled with each breath, allowing 'new' air to mix with 'old' air."}
{"question": "The same quantity of electricity was passed through two separate electrolytic cells.

From the reaction Cu^2++ 2e^- \\rightarrow Cu(s) we see that it takes two moles of electrons (2 F) to deposit one mole of copper.

Since 3.18g of Cu were deposited and this is equal to one-tenth the atomic weight (0.1 \u00d7 31.8 = 3.18), one-tenth of a Faraday (0.1 F) was passed through the CuSO_4 cell.

{"question": "In what way does Lamarck's theory of acquired characteristicsnot agree with present evidence?", "solution": "Lamarck, like most biologists of his time, believed that organisms areguided through their lives by innate and mysterious forces that enable themto adapt to and overcome adverse environmental forces. He believed that, once made, these adaptations are trans-mitted from generation to generation - that is, that acquired characteristics are inherited . In Lamarck's belief, then, new organs can arise in response to demands of the environment, their size being proportional to their use. Changes in the size of such organs are inherited by succeeding generations . An example of this, according to Lamarck was the giraffe's long neck. He claimed that it resulted when an ancestor of the present giraffe took to eating the leaves of trees, instead of grass. Since the giraffe had to continually reach up to eat, its neck became stretched. The longer neck that developed was then inherited by the giraffe's descendants. Lamarck's theory of the inheritance of acquired traits, though attractive, is unacceptable. Overwhelming genetic evidence indicates that acquiredcharacteristics cannot be inherited. Many experiments have been performedin attempts to demonstrate the inheritance of acquired traits, all endingin failure. Geneticists now firmly believe that acquired traits cannot beinherited because they are not translated into a genetic message and in-corporatedinto the genetic apparatus - the chromosomes - of cells. In particular, the genes of the sex cells are not changed. In other words, acquiredtraits involve changes only in the phenotype, not in the genotype; forthis reason they are not inherited, and thus, are of no evolutionary significance.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F27-0713.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "Acquired characteristics cannot be inherited"}

{"question": "Find the pH of 0.15 M H_2SO_4, solution, assuming K_2 =1.26 \u00d7 10^-2.", "solution": "Begin this problem by noting that pH = - log [H^+]. Thus, to find pH, calculate the [H^+] in 0.15 M H_2SO_4. H_2SO_4 is an acid and dissociates into H^+ (= H_3O^+) ions. The general reaction for acid dissociation can be written as HA + H_2O \\rightleftarrows H_3O^+ + A^-. H_2SO_4 undergoes this reaction, as H_2SO_4 + H_2O \\rightleftarrows H_3O^+ + HSO_4^-. But note, HSO_4^- is also an acid, it still possesses a hydrogen that can dissociate. Thus, one also has HSO_4^- + H_2O \\rightleftarrows H_3O^+ + SO_4^-. In other words, there exist two dissociation reactions. As given, the dissociation constant for the second reaction, K_2, measures the ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants. It is from this expression that [H^+] can be determined. H_2SO_4 is a very strong acid in its first dissociation reaction. This means it is completely ionized; i.e. 100% of the H^+ comes off (the first H^+ only). Thus, if there are 0.15 M of H_2SO_4, then, there are also 0.15 = [H^+] for the first dissociation. [H^+] = [HSO_4^-], as can be seen from the first dissociation reaction and are formed inequimolaramounts. Also, [HSO_4^-] = 0.15 (initially). For the second ionization, one is given K_2 = 1.26 \u00d7 10^-2, indicating dissociation is not complete. From the prior explanation of what K_2 indicates, one can write K_2 = 1.26 \u00d7 10^-2 = {[H_3O^+] [SO_4-]} / [HSO_4^-]. Note: Water is not included since it is assumed to be a constant. From the first dissociation, it is known that [H_3O^+] = 0.15. If x moles/liter of H^+ is produced in the second dissociation, the total [H_3O^+] = 0.15 + x. [SO_4 =] = [H_3O^+] from the second dissociation, since here they are formed in equimolar amounts. Thus, [SO_4-] = x. If one started with [HSO_4^-] = 0.15M (from the first dissociation) and x moles/liter dissociate in the second, one has [HSO_4^-] = 0.15 - x left. Substituting these values, 1.26 \u00d7 10^-2 = {[H_3O^+] [SO_4-]} / [HSO_4^-] = {(0.15 + x) (x)} / (0.15 - x) Solving for x (using the quadratic formula), x = .011.

{"question": "How has the role of internal body secretions in behavior been demonstrated in silk worms?", "solution": "Although much of the stimuli which trigger specific behavioral responses have an external origin, many responses occur as a result of internal stimulation. Much of this internal stimulation is initiated by hormones. The silkworm larva must spin its cocoon at a certain time in life, just following its larval stage. The stimulus for the spinning behavior comes from the disappearance of a specific substance, juvenile hormone. This is secreted by the corporaallata, a pair of glands located behind the brain of the silkworm. The secretion of juvenile hormone prevents the spinning of the cocoon. As the larva grows, the level of juvenile hormone drops, allowing for the spinning reaction to occur. No external sign stimuli is necessary, only internal hormonal levels.

At time t + \u2206t the mass of the rocket is m + \u2206m where \u2206m is negative since the total mass of the vehicle is de-creasing, while the velocity is v + \u2206v and the momentum is (m + \u2206m) (v + \u2206v). However, after time \u2206t, since \u2206m in mass leaves the rocket, it introduces its own momentum. In the inertial frame of reference, the velocity of the fuel is v - u which is the velocity of the rocket minus the velocity of the fuel with respect to the rocket. The mass of the fuel ejected during time \u2206t is \u2206m, and so its momentum is \u2206m(v - u). The law of conservation of momentum tells us that, in an isolated system the momentum at time t equals the momentum at t + \u2206t.

This loss of water by evaporation, mainly from the leaves (but also from the stems) is called transpiration. Transpiration plays a very important role in water transport in plants. It directs the upward movement of water and minerals from the soil to the leaves, keeps the air spaces of leaves moist for carbon dioxide to dissolve in, concentrates initially dilute leaf cell solutions of minerals that have been absorbed by the roots, and contributes to the cooling of the plant body by removing heat during the vaporization of water (540 calories of heat are needed to convert each gram of water to water vapor). Transpiration is responsible for the great amount of water that passes through a plant body per day. About 98 per cent of the water absorbed by the roots is lost as vapor. As water is lost by evaporation from the surface of amesophyllcell, the concentration of solutes in the cell sap increases, causing water to pass into it from neighboring cells that contain more water, that is, lower solute concentration. These neighboring cells in turn receive water from thetracheidsand vessels of the leaf veins, which ultimately obtain water from the soil via root hair cells.

{"question": "The gold leaves of the machine in the figure periodically diverge and then collapse. Describe how this perpetual- motion machine operates and explain why it is not a perpetual-motion machine.", "solution": "Radium atoms are radioactive and have a half- life of 1,622 years. For radium ^226 _88 Ra \\ding{217}^222 _86 Rn +4_2 He(1) The alpha particle (the ^42He nucleus) with 2 quanta of positive charge, is ejected with a kinetic energy of 4.77 MeV and escapes from the surface of the metal. Therefore, if a piece of radium is placed on an electroscope stem, the electroscope becomes negatively charged. This is due to the fact that only a part of the radium atom is emitted as an alpha particle. The num-ber of electrons around the radium nucleus remains the same. Thus, for each alpha particle that escapes 2 quanta of ne-gative charge are left on the electroscope mount and gold leaves. As radium atoms decay, the leaves slowly diverge due to the mutual repulsion of the negative charge on the two foil strips. At the instant they touch the grounded metal surface of the container, the negative charge mi-grates from the leaves. The gravitational forces cause the leaves to collapse to their original position. The leaves immediately begin to diverge again, repeating the cycle over and over until there are no more radium nuclei present. Since the half-life of radium is 1,622 years, the machine would \"run\" for many years without any apparent slowing down. From today's perspective, though, we see that the energy source is derived from the nuclear energy released in the nuclear reaction described in (1).

{"question": "What is a pheromone, and how does it differ from a hormone?", "solution": "The behavior of animals may be influenced by hormones - organic chemicals that are released into the internal environment by endocrine glands which regulate the activities of other tissues located some distances away. Animal behavior is also controlled by pheromones - substances that are secreted by exocrine glands into the external environment. Pheromones influence the behavior of other members of the same species. Pheromones represent a means of communication and of transferring information by smell or taste. Pheromones evoke specific behavioral, developmental or reproductive responses in the recipient; these responses may be of great significance for the survival of the species. Pheromones act in a specific manner upon the recipi-ent's central nervous system, and produce either a tempo-rary or a long-term effect on its development or behavior. Pheromones are of two classes: releaser pheromones and primer pheromones. Among the releaser pheromones are the sex attractants of moths and the trail pheromones secreted by ants, which may cause an immediate behavioral change in conspecific individuals. Primer pheromones act more slowly and play a role in the organism's growth and differentiation. For example, the growth of locusts and the number of reproductive members and soldiers in termite colonies are all controlled by primer pheromones.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F21-0532.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Pheromones are substances that are secreted by exocrine glands into the external environment, influencing the behavior of other members of the same species.

Hence, it can be seen that blanks are very important, in a language. To understand what is meant by 'assignment statements' take a simpleexample as follows: X = A + B; The semicolon indicates to the PL/I machine the end of an in-struction. The symbolhas the function of a directed equality sign. It states that the quantityon the left-hand side is defined by the formula on the right-hand side. Or, more precisely, the value created by addition of the two variables onthe right-hand side is taken on by the variable X on the left-hand side. One can say that the newly calcula-ted value (i.e. sum of A & B) is \"assigned\" to the variable X. The complete structure is called 'assignment statement.' It is necessary that the variables A and B, at the instant of calculation, have well defined values. This is not neces-sary for X on the left-handside. If X does not appear in any previous statements its value willbe undefined before execution of the assignment statement. After execution, the value of X will be equal to the sum of the values of A & B. If thereis any previous assignment, say X = 5, before X = A + B, the effect ofthe assignment statement is as follows: Any previous value of X is lost; anew value of X is defined; the old value is replaced by the new value. We have used the term 'variable' for A, B and X while explaining theterm 'assignment statement'. The term 'vari-able' is used to indicate thata value attached to the quan-tity may \"vary\" during the calculations performedby the PL/I machine.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G13-0313.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The PL/I character set consists of 26 capital letters A through Z, 10 digits 0 through 9, and 24 special characters.

{"question": "In writing a basic assembler language program, our first and foremost concern is that of housekeeping. What is housekeep-ing and why is it necessary?", "solution": "The first six or so instructions of the IBM/360- 370 assembly language are the housekeeping instructions. In almost all programs, there is some housekeeping to be done. These instructions provide standard linkage between the program and the operating system. In general, these instructions are: LABELSTART\\varphi \\varphi \\varphi SAVE(14, 12) BALR3, 0 USING\\textasteriskcentered, 3 ST13, SAVE+4 LA13, SAVE These housekeeping instructions have three basic func-tions: 1. They provide standard operating system (OS) program linkage. This is done by means of the SAVE, ST and LA in-structions. 2. They load and identify the base register for the program. The BALR and USING statements perform this task. The third function is not of fundamental concern to the BAL programmer. This step involves preparation of the units and materials needed by the main processing part of the program. In most instances, the task is to open input and output files, a task which the system itself usually fails to perform. Let us now consider the basic functions of each instruc-tion: LABEL START\\varphi: The label is usually the name of the program. \\varphi START\\varphigives the system a location in memory where the program \\varphi should be stored. The address coded is almost never obtained so a zero is substituted, later to be re-placed by the assembler. SAVE (14, 12): Here, the contents of 15 (Register 13 excluded) of the system's 16 general purpose registers are saved. It is important to save the contents of these re-gisters since they may hold information pertinent to the system's operation. The save area generally has a length of 18fullwords, and saving of the registers starts in the fourth word. Let us now discuss the 'ST 13, SAVE+4' and 'LA 13, SAVE' instructions. Because of some system operations which the programmer doesn't need to concern himself with present-ly, it was found to be convenient to store the contents of Register 13 in the secondfullword, (SAVE + 4), of the SAVE area. The 'LA 13, SAVE' simply places the address of the SAVE area in Register 13. This is done so that the area can be referred to, and the contents of the register re-stored at the end of the program. Now, going back, we can look at the 'BALR 3,0' and the 'USING \\textasteriskcentered,3' instructions. The BALR sets up the base regis-ter for the program in Register 3. It then stores the base address (or just the address) of the program. The 'USING \\textasteriskcentered, 3', in effect confirms that Register 3 is the base regis-ter of the program. It tells the computer that starting at that point (indicated by \\textasteriskcentered-asterick) the base register of this program is Register 3. The way these two instructions are coded indicates the natural order of these two instruc-tions in most assembly language housekeeping procedures. The choice of the base register, of course, is left up to the programmer. From the above discussion we can clearly see why house-keeping is of foremost concern to the programmer. It allows the computer to preserve, for later use, the present con-tents of its registers, and it enables the assembler to properly place the users program in core.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G09-0188.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Housekeeping in assembly language programming refers to the first few instructions that provide standard linkage between the program and the operating system.

{"question": "Discuss and illustrate the meaning of absolute and relative addressing.", "solution": "One does not need an in depth knowledge of com-puter science to realize that any program loaded into the main memory of a computer is stored at a particular address. In basic assembler language, by means of a BALR instruction, the address of the first instruction of the program is al-ways placed in a base register. We can safely say that this address never has location \"zero.\" This is so because the first section of the computer's memory is reserved for the operating system. If we call the address at which the pro-gram is loaded its ENTRY address, then, in general, to cal-culate the address of any of the program's symbols, we must add the distance (number of bytes) that is between the sym-bol and the ENTRY address to the ENTRY address. For example if the ENTRY address' location is 925 and the symbol is 48 bytes away, then the address of the symbol is 925 + 48 = 973; the symbol is at location 973. The ENTRY address and the process of adding the displacement dictate what is known as the absolute address of the program and its symbols. In fact, the absolute address of a symbol is its actual loca-tion in main memory. In relative addressing however, we are only interested in the positions which statements occupy relative to the beginning of the program. As a result of this we do not concern ourselves with the contents of the base register (since it is constant for all statements in the program) in calculating this address. The relative address is merely the distance of a particular statement from the beginning of the program.

{"question": "BothHClandNaOHare strong electrolytes.

{"question": "Suppose thecodonsfor amino acids consisted of only two bases rather than three. Would there be a sufficient number ofcodonsfor all twenty amino acids? Show how you obtain your answer.", "solution": "There are two ways to approach this question. One way is to use a mathematical principle known as permuta-tion and the other is to do it by common sense. The latter method will be discussed first. In this question, we are told that acodonconsists of two bases only. We know there are four different kinds of bases in DNA, namely adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine. To get the total number of possible two-basecodons, we will have to pick from the four bases and put them into two positions on thecodon. For the first position, we can have any one of the four bases. That means there are four possible ways of filling the first position. For each of these four possible first positions, we again can put any one of the four bases into the second position. The only restriction we face is the number of different bases we have, which is four. So the total number ofcodonsconsisting of two bases is 4 \u00d7 4 or 16 codons. The other way to solve this problem is to use per-mutation. The general formula used in permutation isnPr= n^r where n is the total number of objects and r is the number of times permuted. nPr is read as \"n permuted r times,\" and n^r as \"n to the power of r.\" Applying this formula: n is the number of different bases (that is, 4) and r is the number of bases in acodon(which is 2) . Substi-tuting in the numerical data, we have the total possible number ofcodonsmade up of 2 bases. (n^r) = 4^2 =16 In either case, we arrive at the same answer.

It is defined as stress/strain = \u2206P/(\u2206V/V) .

{"question": "Do you believe the various races of man living today constitute one species or several? Why? What characteristics distinguish the present races of man?", "solution": "The populations of man are now more diverse than ever in history. From all of the stereotyping that we are accustomed to, we all know each race's distinct physical and cultural features. But because the populations of large cities consist of samplings from almost every race, and interracial matings , the human races are slowly losing their characteristic distinctions. It would be improper to consider each race a separate species since individuals of any race are capable of mating with any other individual of another race and of producing fertile offspring. This is the major characteristic in deciding whether organisms belong to the same species. Thus, the various races of man living today constitute only one species. Genetically, a race is a subdivision of a species that consists of a population with a characteristic combi-nation of gene frequencies. Races are populations that differ from one another not in any single feature, but in having different frequencies of many genes that affect body proportions, skull shape, degree of skin pigmentation, tex-ture of hair, abundance of body hair, form of eyelids, thickness of lips, frequencies of various blood groups, tasting abilities and many other anatomical and physiological traits. While each race has its fundamental characteristics, no race is \"pure\" because the evolutionary history of human beings has been one of continuous intermixture of races as peoples migrated, invaded and conquered their neighbors or were conquered by them. The worldwide inter-breeding typical of mankind is a characteristic which is absent in other higher primates. The daily or lifetime range of other individual prima-tes or primate social groups is relatively small. For example, most apes need to be close to a source of water and to the same food supply that they are accustomed to, thus their diet is not very diverse. They also need a form of shelter for protection when they sleep at night. In addition, most apes remain in the small close-knit social group that they were born into during their entire lifetime. Because of the non-migrating feature of ages, there is only little genetic diversity within the various species. Widespread migration and interbreeding in humans are thus primarily responsible for the genetic diversity of races. Almost every combination of genes has the possibility of occurring in mankind and this might be related to the evolutionary advances that have taken place in our history as well as those that will take place in the future. Mankind is evolving even today, but the rate is extremely slow. Usually an organism will tend to evolve or adapt in response to a change or stress in its environment. Living in a large city, with all of its pollution, technology, tension, and stress, any prove to be a selection pressure for individuals who can better function in this type of situation.

{"question": "What is the Lorentz contraction of an automobile traveling at 60 mph ? (60 mph is equivalent to 2682 cm/sec.)", "solution": "Suppose we are given two frames of reference moving relative to one another with a velocity v (see figure). If we are dealing with classical physics and want to relate the coordinates of an event occurring in the S - frame (x, y, z , t) to the coordinates of an event occurring in the S'-frame (x', y', z', t'), we use the Galilean trans-formation , or x' = x - vt y' = y (If v is in the x-direction only.) z' = z t' = t. In relativistic physics, this transformation is invalid, and must be replaced by the Lorentz transformation , or x' = (x - vt) / \\surd{1 - (v^2 / c^2)} y' = y z' = z t' = {t - (vx / c^2)} / \\surd{1 - (v2/ c^2)} . Now, we may relate distances measured in S' to distances as measured in S. Let us imagine the measurement of a dis-tance parallel to the x'-axis in the S' frame. In order to measure the length of a rod in S, we must locate both ends of the rod (x_1, x_2) at the same time (t_1 = t_2 ) in S. Hence, the length in S' is x'_2 -x'1= [(x_2 - x_1) - {v (t_2 - t_1)}] / [\\surd{1 - (v^2 / c^2)}] . But t1= t2, therefore x'_2 -x'1= (x_2 - x_1) / \\surd{1 - (v^2 / c^2)} . Hence (x_2 - x_1) = x'2-x'1\\surd{1 - (v^2 / c^2) }.(1) Since\\surd{1 - (v^2 / c^2)} < 1 we then have x_2 - x1< x'2-x'_1 . The observerin S measures a smaller rod length (contracted) than the observer in the rod's rest frame, S'. Now, we calculate the length of the car in S, ( x_2 - x_1)If V_r is 2682 cm/sec. Vr/ c = 2682 / (3 \u00d7 10^10) = 8.94 \u00d7 10^-8 {V_r/ c}^2 = 8.0 \u00d7 10^-15 . When x is very much less than 1, \\surd(1 - x) = [1 - {(1/2)x} approximately . Therefore , \\surd{1 - (v_r / c)^2 } \\approx [1 - (4.0 \u00d7 10^-15)]. Substituting in (1) x_2 - x_1\\approx (x'2-x'_1) (1 - 4.0 \u00d7 10^-15) . This means that the change in length of a meter rule is only 4.0 \u00d7 10-15 meters, or 4.0 \u00d7 10^-13 cm. Since the diameter of an atom is about 10^-8 cm, the diameter of a nucleus is about 10^-12 cm and the size of the electron is about 10^-13 cm, this contraction is clearly negligible.

{"question": "Show that the energy eigenvalues E_n, of a particle moving between impenetrable walls is given by the relationship E_n = (h^2/8mL^2)n^2 where h is Planck's constant, m the particle mass, L the distance between the walls, and n = 1, 2, 3, ...", "solution": "In order to find the energy eigenvalues, we must, in general, solve Schroedinger's Equation. Since our problem is one dimensional, this equation reduces to (-h^2/2m) (\u10db2\\psi/\u10dbx^2) + V\\psi = ih(\u10db\\psi/\u10dbt)(1) where m is the mass of the particle we are studying i = \\surd- 1,his Planck's constant over 2\\pi, and V is the potential that m is subject to. \\psi is the wave function which describes the motion of the particle and it is generally a function of x and t. In order to solve (1), we use the method of separation of variables, and express \\psi as the product of 2 functions, one with only a time dependence, and the other with only a spatial depend-ence . Hence, \\psi = \\psi (x) \\textphi (t)(2) Substituting (2) in (1) (-h^2/2m) (\u10db2\\psi/\u10dbx^2) [\\psi (x) \\textphi (t)] + V \\psi (x) \\textphi (t) = ih(\u10db/\u10dbt) [\\psi (x) \\textphi (t)] (-h^2/2m) \\textphi (t) {[d^2 \\psi (x)]/dx^2} + V \\textphi (t) \\psi (x) = ih\\psi (x) [{d \\textphi (t)}/dt] Dividing both sides by \\psi = \\psi (x) \\textphi (t) (-h^2/2m) [1/{\\psi (x)}] [{d^2 \\psi (x)}/dx^2] + V = ih[1/{\\textphi (t)}] [{d \\textphi (t)}/dt](3) Note that if v is a function of x alone, the left side of (3) is also a function of x alone, and the right side is a function only of t. The only way a function of x can equal a function of t is if both functions equal the same constant K. Hence, we separate (3) into (-h^2/2m) [1/{\\psi (x)}] [{d^2 \\psi (x)}/dx^2}] + V = K(4) ih[1/{\\textphi (t)}] [{d \\textphi (t)}/dt] = K(5) Remember that this is true only if V is time in-dependent. We first solve the differential equation in (5). Rewriting this equation [{d \\textphi (t)}/dt] = (K/ih) \\textphi (t) or[{d \\textphi (t)}/{\\textphi (t)}] = (K/ih) dt \\int [{d \\textphi (t)}/{\\textphi (t)}] = (K/ih) \\int dt In \\textphi (t) = (K/ih) t + C where C is a constant. Taking the exponential of both sides \\textphi (t) = e ^[(Kt/ih) + C]= e^c e^k ^t/ih(6) But e^c is a new constant. Letting e^c = A we may write (6) as \\textphi (t) = A c^ Kt/ih= A e - ^i ^k ^t/h(7) Equation (7) may be written in terms of sines and cosines since e^-ix = cos x - i sin x Hence, \\textphi (t) = A [cos Kt/h- i sin Kt/h] and \\textphi (t) is an oscillatory function of time with fre-quency \\omega_0 = K/h. The energy of particle is E = hv and\\omega = (2\\piE/h) = (E/h) But the only physical interpretation \\omega_0 can have is that it is the particle's frequency. Hence \\omega = \\omega_0 or(E/h) = (E/h) andE = K.(8) Putting (8) in (5) [ih/{\\textphi (t)}] [{d \\textphi (t)}/dt] = E orih(d/dt) \\textphi (t) = E \\textphi (t)(9) Equation (9) is an eigenvalue equation, since an operator [(ihd)/dt] acts on a function [\\textphi (t)] and gives back the function multiplied by a constant (E). The constant E, is called the eigenvalue of \\textphi (t). Now that we have found K, we may rewrite (4) as (-h^2/2m) [1/{\\psi (x)}] [{d^2 \\psi (x)}/dx^2] + V = E or(-h^2/2m) [1/{\\psi (x)}] [{d^2 \\psi (x)}/dx^2] = E - V (+h^2/2m) [{d^2 \\psi (x)}/dx^2] = (V - E) \\psi (x)(10) The real problem is to solve (10) for the given V. A particle moving between impenetrable walls is a picturesque way of describing a particle in an infinite potential well. (See figure.) We may describe this V by \\infty, x \\leq 0 V =0, 0 \\leq x \\leq L \\infty, x \\geq L Hence, within the well, V = 0 and (10) becomes [{d^2 \\psi (x)}/dx^2] + (2mE/h^2) \\psi (x) = 0 This is the equation of simple harmonic motion, and has the general solution \\psi (x) = B cos [\\surd(2mE)/h] x + C sin [\\surd(2mE)/h] x(11) In order to \"taper\" (11) to the problem at hand, note that \\psi (0) = 0 \\psi (L) = 0(12) since, if the potential is infinite at these points, we cannot expect to find the particle there. Using (12) in (11) \\psi (0) = B = 0 \\psi (L) = B cos [\\surd(2mE)/h] L + C sin [\\surd(2mE)/h] L = 0 HenceC sin [\\surd(2mE)/h] L = 0 C cannot be 0, otherwise \\psi (x) = 0 for all x, and this is a trivial solution. Therefore, it must be that sin [\\surd(2mE)/h] L = 0 or[{L \\surd(2mE)}/h] = n\\pin = 1, 2, ...(13) Note that if n = 0 in (13), this implies that E = 0, always. Again, (11) would be a trivial solution for this case, since B = 0. Hence, E = [(n^2 \\pi^2h^2)/(L^2 2m)] = [n^2 h^2/8mL]n = 1, 2, ...

{"question": "How much area, in square meters, will one liter of paint cover if it is brushed out to a uniform thickness of 100 microns?", "solution": "Because one is asked to give the final area in square meters, one should first convert the volume and thickness to meter units.

Reproduction in the frog takes place in the water. The male siezes the female from above and both discharge their gametes simultaneously into the water. This process is known as amplexus.

After a time, the larva under-goes metamorphosis and becomes a young adult frog, with lungs and legs. The same type of system is seen in the salamanders (order Urodela). Like the metamorphosis of insects and other arth-ropods, that of the amphibia is under hormonal control. Amphibia undergo a single change from larva to adult in contrast to the four or more molts involved in the development of arthropods to the adult form.

{"question": "In what ways are eggs and sperm adapted structurally for their respective functions in reproduction?", "solution": "The human sperm consists of a head, a middle piece and a tail. About two-thirds of the head is com-prised of the nucleus. The apical one-third of the head is the acrosome. The acrosome has a conglomerate of enzymes which aid the sperm in penetrating the egg surface in fertilization. Before a sperm can fertilize an egg, it must undergo a process called capacitation followed by the acrosome reaction. Capacitation is the breakdown or removal of a protective coating of the sperm. Following this, small perforations are produced in the acrosome wall, allowing for the escape of enzymes as part of the acrosome reaction. The middle piece contains many mitochondria that provide energy for the movement of the tail. The mito-chondria oxidize nutrients which diffuse into the middle piece from the seminal fluid and thus generate energy for the sperm's motion. The middle piece also contains a centriole which, after fertilization, aids in the division of the zygote. The tail lashes back and forth and propels the sperm. The ovum is massive compared to the sperm, with an abundance of cytoplasm (recall the unequal cytoplasmic division during oogenesis) containing yolk granules. The yolk provides nutrition for the embryo during the early stages of its development. The human ovum is truly large and is just visible to the unaided eye as a tiny speck. Because of its large size and lack of flagella, the egg is nonmotile in contrast to the sperm. The ovum is sur-rounded by two extracellular layers which can be broken down by the enzymatic action of the sperm's acrosome. The inner layer is called the zona pellucida and the outer layer consists of follicular cells which become radially arranged as the corona radiata. The zona pellucida, upon enzymatic degradation by the acrosome, allows the sperm to pass through the egg cell membrane into the cytoplasm. It is also thought to be responsible for the inhibition of entry of more sperm, so that only one sperm will fertilize one egg. The mechanism by which this occurs is not well understood, but it appears to involve some structural changes of the zona pellucida controlled by granules released from the ovum's cytoplasm.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F22-0575.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Sperm is adapted for movement and penetration of the egg, with a head containing enzymes for penetration, a middle piece with mitochondria for energy, and a tail for propulsion.

{"question": "In what ways do mosses and liverworts resemble and differ from each other?", "solution": "Mosses and liverworts are two classes of bryophytes. Being in the same phylum, they resemble each other in several respects. First, they share an ability to live and reproduce on land. Second, they have evolved similar structures to help them survive on land: an epidermis to prevent excessive evaporation, pores on the surface to effect gaseous exchange, rootlike projec-tions called rhizoids for anchorage, and small green leaflets to manufacture food. Third, the two classes have a similar life cycle in which the gametophyte is the dominant generation and thesporophyteis partially dependent upon the gametophyte for water, minerals, and anchorage . Fourth, both produce their sex cells inmulticellularsex organs (calledanantheridiumin the male and anarchegoniumin the female) and have flagel-lated sperm requiring a moist medium for transport. Last, the embryos of both develop protected within the archegonia. However, the mosses and liverworts have certain structural differences which separate them into these two distinct classes. First, the moss plants have an erect stem supporting spirally-arranged leaves. The more primitive liverworts are simply flat, sometimes branched,ribbonlike structures that lie on the ground, attached to the soil by numerous rhizoids . Second, the rhizoids of the liverworts are specialized, unicellular projections extending downward from the leaf-like plant body (thallus).

Third, the liverworts'thallus, unlike the leaflets of the moss, is more than one cell layer thick and bear scales , frequently brown or red, on its lower, ground-facing surface. On the opposite, upper surface are small cups, known asgemmaecups. These form oval structures, thegemmae, which when detached from the parent plant give rise asexually to new game-tophyte individuals.

{"question": "Besides their actions, the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems also differ in the neurotransmitter they release. Explain.", "solution": "Nerves of the parasympathetic system secrete a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. For this reason they are usually referred to as cholinergic neurons. Acetylcholine is also the transmitter at the neuromuscular junction. Nerves of the sympathetic system release noradrenaline, also called norepinephrine, and are thus noradrenergic. Acetylcholine is a strong base, containing a choline moiety. [-CH_2CH_2-N_+-(CH_3)_3] In exists as a cation (positive ion) at physiological pH (about 7.4). Because of its ability to attach to a membrane and create a reversible change in the membrane's permeability to different ions, acetylcholine released by the presynaptic neuron acts to bring about depola-rization and generate an impulse in the postsynaptic neuron. The molecular structure of acetylcholine is: Noradrenaline has a molecular structure containing a ring moiety: The closely related compound adrenaline (epinephrine) - is a hormone released by the adrenal glands, and although its action is similar to that of noradrenaline, it is not a neurotransmitter. The adrenal medulla (inner part of the adrenal gland) acts like a modified post- ganglionic sympa-thetic \"neuron\": it is derived embryologically from neural tissue; it is innervated by a sympathetic preganglionic fi-ber; and it has become specialized to secrete noradrenaline and adrenaline and thus prolongs sympathetic activation.", "images": ["images/F20-0515_files/image002.jpg", "images/F20-0515_files/image004.jpg", "images/F20-0515_files/image006.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F20-0515.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Nerves of the parasympathetic system secrete a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, while nerves of the sympathetic system release noradrenaline, also called norepinephrine."}

{"question": "Birth is associated with a number of rather drastic but important changes that occur in a short period of time. Discuss these changes.", "solution": "Several important changes must occur in the newborn baby in a very short period of time. During the time of its development in the mother, the fetus obtained all its oxygen and eliminated its CO_2 through the placenta. Its lungs were collapsed. Shortly after birth, when the placenta is no longer present, the carbon dioxide level in the blood of the baby rises to the point at which it stimulates the respiratory center in the medulla of the brain to ini-tiate breathing. The lungs fill with air for the first time and normal breathing follows. A second important change occurs in the heart and blood vessels. In the fetal heart there exists a hole between the right and left atria called the foramenovale, allowing blood from both sides of the heart to mix. In addition, in the fetus there exists a duct between the pulmonary artery and the aorta. This duct, termed theductusarteriosus, effectively cuts down the blood supply to the lungs by diverting it into the aorta. At the time of birth, theductusarteriosusbecomes constricted and eventually is completely blocked. This allows more blood to enter the lungs, the flow increasing by approximately seven times. Also at this time the flaps around the opening between the atria fuse together, thus effectively separating the two atria and allowing the heart to function as two separate pumps. While in the mother's womb the heart serves to pump oxygenated blood, obtained from the mother, to the rest of the fetal body. When the fetus is born, however, the heart must serve the function of pumping deoxygenated blood to the lungs as well as oxygenated blood to the rest of the body. Should the foramenovalefail to close, deoxygenated and oxygenated blood would be able to mix and the infant would be deprived of its full oxygen supply.

Also, T_2 = (xy_2)' = x' + y'_2 (by De Morgan's laws) and,z = (y'_1 y_2)' = y_1 + y'_2 (by DeMorgan's laws). Step II, Now, we plot each equation T_1, and T_2 into a Karnaugh Map for y_1y_2 and x, as follows: Now, in order to convert a T flip-flop into an S-C flip-flop, we make the following observations: i) The excitation equations of the T and S-C type flip-flops, for y_1\\rightarroware: \\rightarrow y_1\\rightarrow= T_1 \\textbullet y'_1 + T'_1 \\bullet y_1 y_1\\rightarrow= T_1 \\textbullet y'_1 + T'_1 \\bullet y_1 \\rightarrow and, and, y_1\\rightarrow= S_1 \\textbullet y'_1 + C' \\textbullet y y_1\\rightarrow= S_1 \\textbullet y'_1 + C' \\textbullet y \\rightarrow 1 ii) On putting y_1 = 0 (and hence y_1' = 1), in both the above equations, we get: y_1\\rightarrow= T_1 \\bullet 1 + T'_1 \\bullet 0 = T_1 \\rightarrow and, y_1\\rightarrow= S_1 \\bullet 1 + C'_1 \\bullet 0 = S_1. \\rightarrow Hence we see that in our Karnaugh Map for T_1, the first two rows (viz., for y_1y_2 = 00 and 01, i.e., for which y_1 = 0), correspond to T_1 or S_1. iii) Similarly, on putting y_1 = 1 (and hence y'_1 = 0) in the above equations, we get: y_1\\rightarrow= T_1 \\bullet 0 + T'_1 \\bullet 1 = T'_1, \\rightarrow and, y_1\\rightarrow= S_1 \\bullet 0 + C'_1 \\bullet 1 = C'_1. \\rightarrow \\therefore (y_1\\rightarrow)' = T_1 , \\rightarrow and, (y_1\\rightarrow)' = C_1 (complementing both sides in the above equation). \\rightarrow Hence, we see that the last two rows of our Karnaugh Map for T_1, viz., y_1y_2 = 11 and 10 are complements of y_1\\rightarrow, and correspond to the \\rightarrow remainder of T_1 in a T flip-flop, or to C_1 in an S-C flip-flop. Step III. In view of the observations i), ii), and iii), we can now split up T_1 into its components for S_1 and C_1. The fig. (3a) for T_1 leads to fig. (3b) for y_1\\rightarrowby complementing the entries \\rightarrow For y_1y_2 = 11 and 10 from fig. (3a), as explained in observation iii) before. Fig. (3b) is now split up into two parts corresponding to y_1 = 0 and y_1 = 1 in fig. (3c) and fig. (3d), respectively. Note that fig. (3d) uses the complements of the entries in fig. (3b). We could have split up fig. (3a) directly into the figs. (3c) and (3d) without worrying about the fig. (3b) for y_1\\rightarrow, and the complements. But this \\rightarrow intervening step was used in the example only to illustrate the reasoning in-volved. Step IV. Now complete the partial Karnaugh Maps of figs. (3c) and (3d) by making use of any special properties of the type of flip-flop used. For example, for changing over to J-K flip-flops, all the remaining entries would be don't care conditions, \"d\". But, an SC type flip-flop, must satisfy the condition S\\bulletC = 0. Hence, fill up the empty blanks such that the product of corresponding blanks in the Maps for S_1 and C_1 = 0. This is done as follows, in fig. (4): Where a zero already exists in one of the partial Karnaugh Maps, a 'd' can be entered in the corresponding square in the other Karnaugh Map. This is because the product of S_1 = 0 and C_1 = 0 or 1 will always be 0. For example, note that a 0 already exists in the Karnaugh Map for S_1 in the square for y_1y_2 x equal to 00 0. Hence, a 'd' can be entered in the corresponding square for y_1y_2 x equal to 00 0 in the Map for C_1, because S_1 \\textbullet C_1 will equal 0. Similarly, a 'd' is entered in the square for y_1y_2 x equal to 00 1 in the Map for C_1 because there is a 0 in the square for y_1y_2 x equal to 00 1 in the map for S_1. But, the squares for y_1y_2 x equal to 01 0 and 01 1 are entered with zeroes in the Map for because there are 1's in the corresponding squares in the Map for S_1. Similarly, fill up the lower half of the Map for S_1 with d's or 0's according to whether there are 0's or 1's in the corresponding squares in the Map for C_1. Step IV. We now write out equations for S_1 and C_1 S_1 = y'_1y_2(from fig. (4a).) C_1 = y'_2 + y_1 x . (from fig. (4b)) We repeat the Steps III to V for T_2 to get S_2 and C_2. \\therefore S_2 = y'_1x' + y'_1y'_2 = y'_1 \\bullet (x' + y'_2)(from fig. (5d).) (from fig.

{"question": "If it takes 30.3 KJ/mole of heat to meltNaCl, calculate the melting point ofNaCl, assuming the entropy increase is 28.2 J mol^-1 deg^-1.", "solution": "To solve this problem, relate free energy, enthalpy, and entropy. The formula, \u2206G = \u2206H - T\u2206S, does this. \u2206G = free energy, \u2206H = enthalpy, T = tem-perature in Kelvin and \u2206S = entropy. Let T = the melting point of NaCl . Entropy is a measure of randomness. Re-actions are favored that increase the randomness of the system. Reactions will also be favored that proceed to a lower energy state. Above the melting point, randomness increases, but so does energy. However, randomness pre-dominates, and so that solid melts, when the temperature is greater than the melting point. The situation below the melting point is exactly the opposite; here the energy consideration predominates. Only at the melting point, or when the solid and liquid are in equilibrium, will \u2206H and T\u2206S be equal. As such, at the melting point \u2206G = 0.

{"question": "Gastrulation in the bird is accomplished by a form of cell migration that differs from that of the frog. Explain.", "solution": "In birds, the cells from the epiblast (the upper of two embryonic cell layers) migrate down-ward. Initially, a strip of epiblast extending forward in the midline of the embryo from the posterior edge of the area pellucid becomes thickened as the primitive streak, with a narrow furrow, the primitive groove, in its center. Hensen's node, a thickened knot of cells, is present at the anterior end of the primitive streak. It is by the migration of cells from the lateral portion of the epiblast that the primitive streak is formed. The cells of the epiblast invaginate at the primitive streak, move into the space between the epiblast and hypoblast and reach the latter, forming a mass of moving cells. The cells continue to migrate, moving laterally and anteriorly from the primitive streak area. Though cells are migrating, the shape of the primitive streak remains intact. The primitive streak, where invagination occurs, is considered to be homologous to the amphibian blastopore. The cells which form the notochord arise from Henson's node. The notochord is the rod-shaped structure that forms a skeletal axis in chordates which is re-placed in the vertebrates by vertebrae (in frogs, a special area of mesoderm develops into the notochord). Cells which grow laterally and anteriorly from the primitive streak between the epiblast and the hypoblast become the mesoderm. The original hypoblast cells plus other cells that migrate into the lower layer from the primitive streak form the endoderm, which gives rise to the digestive tract and yolk sac.

{"question": "What is the adaptive importance of display in aggressive behavior?", "solution": "It is necessary to distinguish aggressive behavior between members of the same species from violent predatory behavioral patterns, which are usually directed at members of different species. Aggressive behavior is usually exhibited between same-species males in defending their territory or establishing their status in a social order. The critical factor in aggressive behavior is that most of the fighting consists of display. Aggressivedisplay between fishes. Male pike blennies (Chaenopsis ocellata ) defend territories on the sea floor with highly ritualized exchanges that include lowering of the gill case, raising the fins, gaping of the jaws, and changes of color. Winner is determined by size and aggressiveness. Display consists of ritualized, highly-exaggerated mo-vements or sounds which convey the attack motivation of the contestants. In attempting to appear as formi-dable as possible, the animal often changes the shape of certain body parts in an attempt to make itself appear as large as possible. The adaptive significance of display is that the two contestants are rarely seriously hurt. Aggression is a type of bluff. The contestant's goal is to repel his opponent to a point outside of his territorial boundary or to convince his rival that a certain female is \"taken.\" Aggressive behavior is therefore highly ritualized, with each movement conveying a certain message. It seldom results in bodily harm, even if physical contact is made. The animals can tell without serious fighting which one would be the probable winner if they were to actually fight. It would be biologically deleterious if during every aggressive contest between rivals, the loser were to be killed. Display behavior allows the \"would-be loser\" to escape and establish a territory or acquire a mate elsewhere.

Catastrophic events can solve the problem of overcrowding just as efficiently as a density dependent device. Hurricanes and volcanic explosions can destroy entire populations but these events are too scattered and local to be used as examples for general population controls. More applicable are the common catastrophes which we know as changes in the weather. Nearly all places on the earth suffer seasonal changes from summer to winter, from warm to cold, and from wet to dry. Each of these cyclic changes represents hazards to the animals of each area. Thus, growing populations are frequently cut back, making their normal lives a race to reproduce so quickly that there shall be at least some survivors following the next catastrophe. Unless something happens to prevent the catastrophe from occurring such a popu-lation may never grow large enough to suffer the effects of crowding. Density independent factors may play an important role in limiting some organisms, particularly those with very short life cycles characterized by a growth curve in which the environmental limiting factors do not become effective until after many generations (see fig. 1). A sudden strong density independent limitation then brings growth to an end before density dependent factors can become operative. The density independent effects are definite factors in moving population growth upward or downward, but they cannot hold the population size at a constant level. As a result, populations effected by density independent factors are under control but their numbers fluctuate within wide limits (see fig. 2) and can hardly be described as \"in balance.\"", "images": ["images/F30-0770_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F30-0770.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Density independent effects can take the form of sudden events that are catastrophic to animal populations.

{"question": "How can you prove that oxygen is given off by green plants during photosynthesis?", "solution": "We can show that oxygen is one of the products of photosynthesis by performing a simple experiment. Elodea or some other photosynthetic aquatic plant is placed in a beaker of water and covered with an inverted glass funnel. A rubber tube is attached to the stem of the funnel. This tube is closed off with a pinch cock. The funnel is subsequently raised, creating a column of vacuum in its stem. (See accompanying diagram.) The plant is then exposed to light. The gas given off during the photosynthetic process bubbles upward through the water and fills the column of the stem. To identify the gas, a glowing splinter of wood is applied over the stem of the funnel. Upon removal of the pinch - cock, the glowing splinter bursts into flame. This means that the gas is oxygen, since it supports combustion.", "images": ["images/F09-0219_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F09-0219.htm", "image_question": true, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The gas is oxygen, since it supports combustion."}

You may assume them to be spherical with a diameter of 180 \\AA; also 10^4 \\AA = 1 micron.", "solution": "(a) Because you are told the molecular weight of an average lipid molecule, you need only compute their total weight in the E. coli cell; and then find the number of moles present. A mole is defined as weight in (grams / mo-lecular weight) (MW) . From this, you use the fact that in one mole of any substance, (6.02 \u00d7 10^23) molecules (Avogadro's number) exist. The lipid content is given as 2%. If the total weight of the cell is (2 \u00d7 10^-12) g, the lipid molecules must have a total weight of (.02) (2 \u00d7 10^-12) or 4 \u00d7 10^-14 grams. The average molecular weight of a lipid molecule is given as 700 (g / mole). Thus, you have 4 \u00d7 10^-14 / 700 = 5.71 \u00d7 10^-17 moles of lipid molecules. If 6.02 \u00d7 10^23 mo-lecules are in a mole, then in 5.71 \u00d7 10^-17 moles, there are 6.02 \u00d7 10^23 5.71 \u00d7 10^-17 = 3.44 \u00d7 10^7 lipid molecules. (b) Calculate the volume of both the E. coli cell and the total volume occupied by the ribosomes. Volume of the E. coli cell: It is of cylindrical shape. The volume of a cylinder can be found from the product of its length and the area of its base. The area of the base, a circle. is \\pir^2 , where r = radius. Because the diamater = 2r,the radius of the cylindrical E. coli cell is 1\\mu divided by 2 or 0.5 \\mu. This is converted to 5 \u00d7 10^3 \\AA, by the conversion factor 10^4 \\AA = 1 micron. Similarly, 2\\mu = (2 \u00d7 10^4 \\AA) = length of E. coli cell. Its total volume = (area of circle) (length) = [\\pi(5 \u00d7 10^3)^2 (2 \u00d7 10^4] = 1.57 \u00d7 10^12. Volume of ribosomes: Each ribosome has a diameter of 180 \\AA or a radius of 90 \\AA. It is given that it is a sphere. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula (4 / 3 \\pi^3), where r = radius. Substituting the volume of one ribosome = (4 / 3)\\pi (90)^3 3.05 \u00d7 10^6. If there exists 15,000 ribosomes, their total volume must be (15000) (3.05 \u00d7 10^6) = 4.58 \u00d7 10^10. Therefore, the percentage volume it occupies = (total volume of ribosomes) / (volume of E. coli cell) \u00d7 100 = [(4.58 \u00d7 10^10) / (1.57 \u00d7 10^12)] \u00d7 100 = 2.9%.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E22-0784.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "3.44 \u00d7 10^7 lipid molecules, 2.9%"}

{"question": "Discuss the important effects of gibberellins, cytokinins, and abscisic acid on plant growth.", "solution": "Gibberellins, cytokinins and abscisic acid are the three major types of plant hormones that have been identified in addition to auxins. These three hormones interact with auxins and with each other to regulate biological activities in plants. Gibberellins and cyto-kinins have dominant roles in controlling the early phases of growth and development; auxins become dominant later in controlling cell elongation, and abscisic acid opposes the functions of all these three growth-promoting factors to bring about a well-regulated, balanced pattern of plant growth. Gibberellins function to lengthen stems, stimulate seed germination, induce flower formation, and increase the size of fruits in some species of plants. The for-mer two are their most vital functions. Seed germina-tion is examined here: Just before germination, the embryo of a seed secretes a gibberellin which induces the production of \\alpha-amylase, an enzyme which hydrolyzes the stored starch for energy. The hormone also acti-vates other enzymes of the seed which breaks down the materials of the seed coat, weakening the coat to facilitate the breakthrough of the germinating embryo. It has been shown that actinomycin D inhibits the synthesis of \\alpha-amytlase in response to gibberellin. Actinomycin-D is a known inhibi-tor of DNA-dependent RNA synthesis; this suggests that gibberellins cause the activation of certain enzymes by regulating, in some fashion, the expression of the genetic information contained in the DNA, perhaps by uncovering a portion of the DNA so that it can be transcribed to produce a specific RNA segment. This segment can then be translated to form an enzyme (which is a protein). Cytokinins function in stimulating growth of cells and accelerating their rate of division. Cytokinins can also change the structure of plant tissue: at certain concentrations, cytokinins are shown to cause root and shoot formation in plant tissue cultures. Cytokinins are also found to oppose auxins by causing lateral buds to develop and thus modifying apical dominance. In addition, cytokinins have been demonstrated to prevent leaves from yellowing and hence play a role in delaying senescence. A possible explanation for the mechanism of this function is that cytokinins prevent the progressive \"turning off\" of segments of DNA (associated with aging) that are responsible for the synthesis of enzymes and protein and the production of other compounds such as chlorophyll. Abscisic acid was first reported in the early 1960's, and is now known as a growth-inhibitor in plants. Abscisic acid is collected largely from the ovary bases of fruits, and its concentration here is highest at the time of fruit drop. The hormone acts antagonistically to gibberellins by inhibiting the production of \\alpha-amylase in seeds and triggering seed dormancy. It opposes cyto-kinins by inactivating vegetative buds, causing the yel-lowing of leaves, and reducing the growth rate of plants. Furthermore, it opposes auxins by accelerating abscission (hence its name) and promoting leaf, fruit, flower and branch shedding. It also promotes stomatal closure. In short, by checking growth and reproductive activities of the plant, abscisic acid interacts with the three growth - promoting hormones to bring about an optimal rate of growth and differentiation.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F09-0234.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Gibberellins function to lengthen stems, stimulate seed germination, induce flower formation, and increase the size of fruits.

{"question": "Discuss the physiological basic of phototropism.", "solution": "A physiological explanation of phototropism that has been proposed involves a group of plant hormones called the auxins. The bending of a plant shoot toward light in phototropism takes place as a result of unequal rates of growth between the side facing the light and the side shielded from the light. Since growth of an organism involves cell division and enlargement, the difference in the rate of growth in the two sides of the plant reflects a difference in the rate of cell division or enlargement or both. Auxins are known to accelerate cell growth in actively growing regions, such as stem tips and vascular cambium. These hormones have been demonstrated to be produced by the apical meristem, and shown to be transported down the stem from the apex in an active process. In response to unidirectional light, it is found that there is a differential distribution of auxin in the stem, the side of the stem facing light receiving a lower concentration of auxin than the side away from light. Phototropism is proposed to be the effect of this uneven distribution of auxin as it moves down the stem from the apex. This mechanism suggests that as light strikes a plant unilaterally, the absorption of light energy by pigments such as carotenoids or flavins initiates the differential distribution of auxin. The exact mechanism by which this occurs is not known, but several hypotheses have been advanced. Some workers suggest that light causes greater destruction of auxin on the lighted side of the stem, or that light produces oxidation products of auxin which inhibit auxin transport down the lighted side. Others postulate that the plant redistributes the auxin that is being synthesized and transports it laterally to the shaded side. However it is accomplished, it is certain that the shaded side has a higher auxin concentration and elongates faster than the illuminated side with a lower auxin level.

One of the problems was to find out how many nucleotides are needed to code for one amino acid. We know that there are four different types of nucleotides because there are four different nitrogenous bases. We also know that there are 20 kinds of amino acids. Four nucleotides taken two at a time provide only 16 different combinations (4^2 = 16), which are insufficient to code for the 20 different amino acids. Four nucleotides taken three at a time provide 64 different combinations (4^3 = 64). At first glance, this would seem to provide many more terms than are needed, since there are only 20 different amino acids. It was believed at one time that the excess combinations were not used to specify any amino acids. However, there is now strong evidence that all but three of the 64 combinations do, in fact, code for amino acids, and that as many as six different nucleotide triplets may specify the same amino acid. The term degeneracy is used to describe the fact that a given amino acid may be specified by more than onecodon. The fundamental characteristics of the genetic code are now well established: it is a triplet code, with three adjacent nucleotides, termed acodon, specifying each amino acid. A second problem with the genetic code is whether there is overlapping or not. For example, is the sequence CAGAUAGAC read only as CAG, AUA, GAC or can it also be read CAG, AGA, GAU, AUA, UAG, AGA, GAC? Is each nucleotide part of onecodonor three? The amino acid sequences of several mutant forms of the hemoglobin molecule have been analyzed. In each, only a single amino acid in the molecule is sub-stituted. In contrast, if the code were overlapping and a given nucleotide were part of three adjacentcodons, we would expect three adjacent amino acids to be changed. For example, a single substitution (circled) in the sequence CAG A UA GAC, resulting in CAGCUAGAC, would affect only the amino acid specified by AUA if no overlapping occurred. If there were overlapping, such a change would affect 3 amino acids, namely those coded for by AGA, GAU, and AUA. Experi-ments with syntheticpolynucleotideshaving known base sequences have shown conclusively that the code is not over-lapping. One can synthesize a messenger RNA strand con-taining onlyuracil, UUUUU... (polyuridylic acid). For every 3 bases added to the mRNA, only one additional phenylalanine will be incorporated into its peptide chain (the UUUcodon codes for phenylalanine). Finally, the code iscommaless, i.e., no punctuation is necessary, since the code is read beginning at a fixed point, three nucleotides at a time, until the reading mechanism comes to a specific 'termination'codon, which signals the end of the message. The fact that there is punctuation betweencodonsbecomes important in deletion or insertion mutations. Adding or subtracting a nucleotide within a sequence ofcodonsthrows the entire reading frame and can change out of line everycodonpast the point of insertion or deletion. For example, the gene sequence AGAUCUUGG would normally be read as AGA, UCU, UGG and would code for the amino acidsarginine, serine, and tryptophan. The insertion of an extra nucleotide (circled), would result in the sequence AGAU G CUUGG, which would read AGA, UGC, UUG and code forarginine,cysteine, andleucine. The deletion of a nucleotide would have a similar effect. If C were eliminated, the code would read AGA, UUU, and would code forarginine and phenylalanine.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F24-0616.htm", "image_question": true, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The genetic code is a triplet code, with three adjacent nucleotides, termed a codon, specifying each amino acid.

{"question": "What prevents the stomach from being digested by itsown secretions?", "solution": "The lining of the stomach is composed of cells that secrete hydrochloricacid, gastric juice, and mucus. Mucus is a polymer made up ofrepeating units of a protein- sugar complex. A coat of mucus, about 1 to 1(1/2) millimeters in thickness, lines the inner surface of the stomach. Mucus is slightly basic. This alkalinity provides a barrier to acids, keeping thearea next to the stomach lining nearly neutral. In addition, the membranesof the cells lining the stomach have a low permeability to hydrogenions, preventing acid from entering the underlying cells. The cells that make up the stomach (and duodenum) lining do not lastlong, even under this protection. Cell division and growth replace the entirestomach lining every 1 to 3 days. Thus the mucus layer, the permeabilityof the membranes and the continual replacement of the cells comprisingthe lining all help protect the underlying tissues from the action ofproteolyticenzymes of the stomach and duodenum. For many people, however, this does not provide enough protection. If too much acid is released, perhaps because of emotional strainor because theproteolyticenzymes have digested away the mucus, anulcer will result. Ulcers are usually treated by eating many small, bland mealsthroughout the day. This helps to keep the acid level down.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F17-0428.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The mucus layer, the permeability of the membranes and the continual replacement of the cells comprising the lining all help protect the underlying tissues from the action of proteolytic enzymes of the stomach and duodenum."}
{"question": "What is the advantage of using DMA? When is DMA used?", "solution": "Computers with the DMA (direct memory access) feature have a direct link between the memory section and the I/O section. Thus, data can be transmitted to and from peripherals without intervention by the CPU. The advantage of using DMA is that the time to transfer data is limited only by the memory access time (usually less than one microsecond). Data transfer to the CPU of a computer without DMA requires several instruction cycles and takes ten to twenty times longer. Figure 1 shows the connections required for direct memory access. The DMA controller located in the I/O section handles data transfers just like the CPU. The \"DMA request\" control signal ensures that the CPU retains control of memory usage. The Address bus and data bus shown can be the same busses that connect the CPU to memory. The DMA is used with high-speed peripherals such as mag-netic disk, high-speed communication lines, and CRT displays.", "images": ["images/G05-0105_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G05-0105.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "DMA is used with high-speed peripherals such as magnetic disk, high-speed communication lines, and CRT displays."}
{"question": "How are tracers useful as a debugging aid?", "solution": "Suppose a computer runs and executes a program but produces incorrect results. If the programmer is unable to locate the bugs by the usual methods (running test data, checking size dimensions, etc.), an emergency technique called tracing can be applied. Tracing is usually done with an interpreter, whose routine dissects, analyzes and executes pseudo-instructions. (Pseudo-instructions do not form part of the program but are neces-sary for its execution). The tracer is an interpretive routine that analyzes and executes real machine instructions one at a time. To understand its opera-tion consider the following problem: The trouble with the program being debugged is suspected to be in the action of a loop. While the loop is being executed, the values of some variables go out of bounds. Using the tracer routine, the contents of the accumulator are printed out before each instruc-tion in the loop is executed. The point at which the variables misbehave can thus be located. The advantage of the trace routine is that the complete internal program is available for external inspection. This is, at the same time, its disadvantage. A series of nested loops may require a few thousand iterations. All these iterations will be executed and printed at printer speed. Clearly, the computer time involved is prohibitive. Hence, tracing functions have been modified to execute only non-branch commands, attached to high speed printers. If a branch is met, selected registers are printed before execution of the branch.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G25-0593.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "Tracers dissect, analyze and execute instructions one at a time, allowing the programmer to locate the point at which variables misbehave."}

{"question": "What controls the process of molting incrustacea?", "solution": "Most crustaceans have successive molts. With each molt, they go through a gradual series of immature, larval stages, until they finally reach the body form characteristic of the adult. The lobster, for example, molts several times early in life, and at each molt it gets larger and resembles the adult more. After it reaches the adult stage, additional molts with only changes in size allow growth of the animal to continue. Molting is under the control of a hormone released from nerve cells. Secretion by nerve cells rather than glands, is known as neurosecretion . An \"antimolting\" hormone is produced by a cluster of nerve cell bodies located near the eyestalk, called the X-organ. The axons of these cells are expanded at their tips, and it is in these expanded tips that the hormone is stored. The bundles of axons together constitute the sinus gland (note that the sinus gland is actually misnamed for it is not a glandular tissue) . Proof that the sinus gland secretes a hormone inhibiting molting comes from surgical removal of this gland, which resulted in repeated molting by the crustacean. Theantimoltinghormone prevents the secretion of & hormone by the Y-organ, a gland composed ofectodermalcells located at the base of themandibularmuscles. When the sinus gland hormone falls below a certain level in the blood, the Y-organ is stimulated to release its hormone. This hormone initiates the event of molting. Just before molting, epidermal cells, stimulated by the Y-organ hormone, secrete enzymes which digest the chitin and proteins of the inner layers of the old cuticle. A soft, flexible, new cuticle is then deposited under the old one, with folds to allow for growth. At this point, the crustacean seeks a protected retreat or remains in its burrow. In order to rid itself of its old shell, a crustacean will take in enough water to swell its body up to three to four times its normal size. The resulting pressure which builds up on the old, rigid shell causes it to burst. The underlying new shell, how-ever, is pliable enough to accommodate the larger size. Eventually, theintaken water is replaced by the growth of new tissue. Water and air are taken in and the old skeleton swells up and bursts, as he new skeleton expands. The animal then extricates itself from the old skeleton. The epidermis secrete enzymes to harden the new cuticle by oxidizing some of the compounds and by adding calcium carbonate to the chitin. The new exoskeleton is com-pleted after subsequent secretion of additionalcuticulelayers.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F12-0315.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "Molting is under the control of a hormone released from nerve cells."}

{"question": "In humans and some other mammalian species, offspring are usually produced singularly. However, sometimes two or more offspring are born at the same time. What are the different methods of producing twins in humans?", "solution": "It is not unusual for human mothers to give birth to more than one offspring at the same time. Basically, there are two kinds of twinning that can occur. One results from the simultaneous release of two eggs (one from each ovary). Both of these eggs can be ferti-lized and develop. Such fraternal twins or heterozygous twins may be of the same or different sex and have the same degree of resemblance that normal brothers and sisters have. They are entirely independent individuals who have about 25% of their genetic information in common, as do normal siblings. Although they may be situated close together in the uterus, fraternal twins have separate fetal membranes. True or identical twins, also termed homozygous twins, are the products of a single egg fertilized by a single sperm. At some early stage of development, the egg divides into two (or more) independent parts, with each developing into a separate fetus. Since they come from the same fertilized egg, they are genetically identical and, therefore, are of the same sex. Such twins usually arise from the same blastocyst. Two sepa-rate inner cell masses may arise from a single blastocyst or a single cell mass may divide into two. In these cases, the twins will have separate amnions and umbilical cords, but share the chorion and placenta. If, however, a single cell mass develops into two embryos, the twins will share amnion, chorion, and placenta (see Figure). Occasionally, identical twins develop without separating completely and are born joined together, and are termed Siamese twins. All grades of union have been known to occur, from almost complete separation to fusion throughout most of the body so that only the head or legs are double. Sometimes the two twins are of different sizes and degrees of development. One might be quite normal, while the other might be an incompletely formed parasite of the first. Such errors of development usually cause death during or shortly after birth.", "images": ["images/F22-0585_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F22-0585.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Fraternal twins result from the simultaneous release of two eggs, each fertilized and developed separately.

Solving for I_L = (1800 watts/120 volts) = 15.0 amp Using Ohm's Law,V = I_f R_f,(1) orI_F = (V/R_F) = (120 volts/240 ohms) = 0.500 amp By Kirchoff's current law, the sum of the currents entering a junction equals the sum of the current leaving the junction. Therefore, at point Q I_A = I_F + I_L = 0.50 amp + 15.0 amp = 15.5 amp. By Kirchoff's voltage law, the sum of the voltage drops about a loop is zero. Applying this law to loop (1), we obtain \\epsilon = I_fR_f + I_AR_A Using (1) \\epsilon = V + I_AR_A \\epsilon = 120 volts + (15.5 amp)(.4 ohms) \\epsilon = 126 volts The input power P_i = I_A \\epsilon = 15.5 amp \u00d7 126 volts = 1950 watts and it is delivered by the generator. The output power is the power delivered to the line, and it is given as 1800 watts.

{"question": "What is the acceleration of a block on a frictionless plane What is the acceleration of a block on a frictionless plane in-clined at an angle \\texttheta with the horizontal?", "solution": "In order to find the acceleration, a, of the block, we must calculate the net force, F, on the block, and relate this to its acceler-ation via Newton's Second Law, F = ma.

{"question": "In the electroplating of nickel from a solution containing Ni^2+ ion, what will be the weight of the metal deposited on the cathode by a current of 4.02 amperes flowing for 1000 minutes?", "solution": "When Ni^2+ plates out of solution, the reaction can be stated as Ni^2+ + 2e^- \\rightarrow Ni . This means that for every Ni^2+ ion that deposits on the cathode, 2 electrons must be used. These electrons will be obtained from the current. One mole of electrons is commonly called one Faraday. One can see from the reaction that 2 Faradays are needed to convert one mole of Ni^2+ to Ni. (1 Faraday = 96,500 coulombs). The MW. of Ni is 58.7, therefore, 2 Faradays will plate out 58.7g of Ni. Since the number of coulombs determines the amount of Ni that plates onto the cathode, the number of coulombs that flow in this current during 1000 minutes needs to be calculated. It is stated in the problem that a current of 4.02 amperes flows for 1000 minutes. One ampere is de-fined as one coulomb per second ampere = coulomb/second. To find the total number of coulombs that were transmitted to the Ni^2+ ions, the amperage of the current must be multiplied by the time the current was flowing. The time must be converted from minutes to seconds by use of the conversion factor, 60 secs/1 minute. no. of coulombs = 4.02 coulombs/sec. \u00d7 1000 min. \u00d7 60 sec/minute = 24,120 coulombs.

{"question": "Even though there is no such thing as a \"typical cell\" - for there are too many diverse kinds of cells - biologists have determined that there are two basic cell types. What are these two types of cells?", "solution": "Cells are classified as either procaryotic or eucaryotic. Procaryotes are strikingly different from eucaryotes in their ultrastructural characteris-tics. A key difference between the two cell types is that procaryotic cells lack the nuclear membrane characteristic of eucaryotic cells. Procaryotic cells have a nuclear region, which consists of nucleic acids. Eucaryotic cells have a nucleus, bounded by a double-layered membrane. The eucaryotic nucleus consists of DNA which is bound to proteins and organized into chromosomes. Bacteria and blue-green algae are procaryotic unicellular organisms. Other organisms, for example, protozoa, algae, fungi, higher plants and animals are eucaryotic. Within eucaryotic cells are found discrete regions that are usually delimited from the rest of the cell by membranes. These are called membrane-bounded subcellular organelles. They perform specific cellular functions, for example, respiration and photo-synthesis. The enzymes for these processes are located within membrane-bounded mitochondria and chloroplasts, respectively. In procaryotic cells, there are no such membrane-bounded organelles. Respiratory and photo-synthetic enzymes are not segregated into discrete organelles although they have an orderly arrangement. Procaryotic cells lack endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and vacuoles. In short, pro-caryotic cells lack the internal membranous structure characteristic of eucaryotic cells. There are other differences between procaryotic cells and eucaryotic cells. The ribosomes of bacteria and blue-green algae are smaller than the ribosomes of eucaryotes. The flagella of bacteria are structural-ly different from eucaryotic flagella. The cell wall of bacteria and blue-green algae usually contains muramic acid, a substance that plant cell walls and the cell walls of fungi do not contain.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F02-0031.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "Procaryotic and eucaryotic"}

{"question": "Give an example of a distributed lag model for the national economy, using the national accounting scheme. Is the computer essential for dealing with distributed lag models?", "solution": "In simulation studies, a problem in the real world is solved using a simple mathematical model in conjunction with the computer. Distributed lag models belong to the class of discrete simulation models. Such models change only at fixed intervals of time, and current values of a given variable are determined by previous values of the same variable. Using Keynesian macroeconomic analysis we can construct a model of the national economy. Let C be consumption, I be investment, T be taxes, G be government expenditure and Y be national income. Then, a general macroeconomic model would be: C = a + c(Y-T) I = b + rY(1) T = tY Y = c + I + G Here, \"a\" represents consumption that is independent of income while \"c\" is the marginal propensity to consume. \"c\" represents the amount per dollar that is spent on con-sumption. \"b\" is investment that is independent of income, and \"r\" is the marginal propensity to invest. Finally, \"t\" is the tax rate per dollar of income. Note that o \\leq c, r, t \\leq 1. Since simulation deals with concrete situations, we should give values to the parameters in (1). Thus, C = 30 + 0.7(Y - T) I= 3+ 0.1(Y)(2) T = . 2Y Y = C + I + G. The above static model can be made dynamic by picking a fixed time interval and then expressing the current values of the variables in terms of values at previous intervals, or lagging them. Thus, we can lag all the variables in (2) by a year to obtain C = 30 + 0.7(Y-1- T_-1) I = 3 + 0.1(Y_-1)(3) T = 0.2Y_-1 Y = C_-1 + I_-1 + G_-1 Model (3) is to be understood as follows: Current consump-tion depends on disposable income from the previous year. Investment is a function of the previous year's national income, as is taxes. In large-scale models, like (3), most calculations can be done without the aid of the computer.

The computer goes to the indirect cycle by letting the R-register become 1 and leaving the F-register 0. When F and R are decoded, the c_1 control line is excited, which designates the indirect cycle.

The infective ability of viruses is due to their nucleic acid composition. An individual virus contains either DNA or RNA but not both as is true for cells . Therefore since the virus proposed in the question contains RNA, it is not affected byDNAase. The RNA replicates, forming a complementary RNA strand which acts as messenger RNA in order to code for the synthesis of new viral proteins. To produce new viral RNA, the viral RNA first synthesizes a complementary strand and thus becomes double- stranded . The double-stranded RNA serves as a template for synthesis of new viral RNA. The virus could have been tobacco mosaic virus, influenza virus or poliomyelitis virus. These are all viruses which contain single- stranded RNA as their genetic material. There are at least two groups of RNA viruses in which the RNA is normally double-stranded, and assumes a double-helical form.

{"question": "What is the function of the leaves? Describe the structures of a typical dicot leaf.", "solution": "The leaf is a specialized nutritive organ of the plant. It's function is to carry out photosynthesis, a process requiring a continuous supply of carbon dioxide, water, and radiant energy. The leaf of a typical dicot consists of a stalk, called the petiole, attached to the stem, and a broad blade, which may be simple or compound. The petiole, like a stem in cross-section, contains vascular bundles. Within the blade, the vascular bundles fork repeatedly and form a network of veins. A cross-section of the leaf shows that it is composed of several types of cells. The outer cells, lining both the top and bottom surfaces of the leaf, make up the epidermis which secretes a protective, waterproof cutin covering. Distributed throughout the epidermal surface are many small, specialized pores, the stomata, each surrounded by two guard cells. There are many more stomata on the lower surface than the upper surface of the leaf in most species. The chloroplast- containing guard cells requlate the size of the stomata by changing their turgor pressure and thus their shape. The stomata allow oxygen to diffuse out and carbon dioxide to diffuse into the leaf. Most of the space between the upper and lower epidermal layers is filled with thin-walled cells, called mesophyll, Most of the space between the upper and lower epidermal layers is filled with thin-walled cells, called mesophyll, which are full of chloroplasts. The mesophyll layer near the upper epidermis is usually made of cylindrical palisade cells, closely packed together with their long axes perpendicular to the epidermal surface. The rest of the mesophyll cells are very loosely packed together, with large air spaces between them. These loosely - packed cells form the spongy layer of the leaf. The cells of the palisade layer, containing abundant chloroplasts, are chiefly responsible for the photosynthetic functioning of the leaf, while the air spaces between the mesophyll of the spongy layer hold moisture and gases.

{"question": "What are the advantages of a segmented body plan? Which animal phyla have segmentation?", "solution": "Segmentation offers the advantage of allowing specialization of different body segments for different functions. More primitive animals have a large number of segments, all very similar to one another. More complex animals have fewer segments, and the specialization of different segments may be so far advanced that the original segmentation of the body plan is obscured. \\textasciigraveAnnelida, the phylum containing earthworms, marine worms, and leeches, is the most primitive invertebrate group displaying segmentation. Earthworms and most marine worms, have both internal and external segmentation. The earthworm body is composed of one hundred or more segments. The segments are separated by partitions termed septa. The marine worms often have incomplete septa, and the leeches have lost the septa completely. Except for a few specialized head and tail segments, the appendages and musculature of all segments are exactly the same. Internally, each segment has a pair of excretory organs and its own ventral nerve ganglion. The earthworm has five pairs of muscular tube-like hearts, two pairs of testes, three pairs of seminal vesicles, and one to five pairs of seminal receptacles.

Theonycophoranshave many similar segments with 14 to 43 pairs of short,unjointedlegs. Arthropods are a large group of segmented animals that have evolved in many complex ways. More primitive forms have paired, similar appendages oneaahsegment. More advanced forms have appendages modified for a variety of functions such as sensory antennae, feeding apparatus, walking legs, swimming legs, claws, reproductive apparatus, and respiratory structures, depending upon the species.

{"question": "A lab technician prepared a calcium hydroxide solution by dissolving 1.48 g of Ca(OH)_2 in water. How many milliliters of 0.125 N HCI solution would be required to neutralize this calcium hydroxide solution?", "solution": "For a neutralization reaction to occur, the number of equivalents of acid must equal the number of equivalents of base. Therefore, one can solve this problem by computing how many equivalents are present in 1.48 g of Ca(OH)_2; the equivalents of acid (HCI) must equal this number. An equivalent is defined as the weight of a substance in grams that releases one mole of protons (H^+.) or hydroxyl ions. When one mole of Ca(OH)_2 dissolves in water, it pro-duces 2 moles of hydroxyl ions (OH^-) according to the equation Ca(OH)_2 \\rightarrow Ca^+2 + 2OH^-. The weight of 1 mole of Ca(OH)_2 is equal to its molecular weight. Therefore, Ca(OH)_2 has a weight of 74 grams. Thus, 74 grams of Ca(OH)_2 produces 2 moles of OH^- ions. Recalling the definition of equivalency, 74/2 = 37 grams is the equivalent weight of Ca(OH)_2. The number of equivalents of Ca(OH)_2 is : Ca(OH)_2 = [(weight in grams)/(equivalent weight)] = (1.48 g/37 g) = 0.04 equiv. The number of equivalents of HCI must also be .04 for neutralization to occur. The normality of HCI is given as 0.125.

{"question": "What is the physiological purpose of shivering?", "solution": "Shivering is a means by which the body maintainsitsnormal temperature when the ambient tem-perature is cold. Recall that heat is produced by virtually all chemical reactions within the body. One way by which the basal level of heat production can be increased is to increase the rate of skeletal muscle contractions. The first muscle changes in response to cold are a gradual and general increase in skeletal muscle tone . This soon leads to shivering, which consists of oscillatory, rhythmic muscle tremors occurring at the rate of about 10 to 20 per second. This intensive muscle activity rapidly uses up ATP, thus stimulating more cellular respiration and more heat production. These contractions are so effective that body heat pro-duction may increase several fold within seconds . Because no external work is performed, all the energy liberated by the metabolic machinery becomes internal body heat. Thus shivering is an adaptation to cold.

{"question": "The transformation of insect larvae into mature adults is known to be under hormonal control. What hormones are involved and what are their effects?", "solution": "A hormonal secretion from the brain stimulates the release of the hormone ecdysone by the prothoracic gland. Ecdysone is the hormone that stimulates growth and molting in insects. Another hormone, present in insects prior to adulthood, is secreted by a portion of the brain known as the corpora allata. This hormone, referred to as juvenile hormone, is responsible for the maintenance of larval structures and inhibits metamorphosis. The juvenile hormone can exert its effect only after the molting process has been initiated. It thus must act in conjunction with the prothoracis hormone. When a relatively high level of juvenile hormone is present in the blood, the result is a larva-to-larva molt. When the level of the juvenile hormone is low, the molt is larva-to-pupa. Finally, in the absence of the juvenile hormone, molting gives rise to adults. Ecdysone has been chemically identified as a steroid and it has been obtained in pure form. The pure extract of ecdysone has been used to investigate the functional mechanism of the hormone. In one recent experiment, small amounts of ecdysone were injected into a gnat. Within fifteen minutes, chromosome puffs (enlargements of certain regions of the chromosome) were observed to form at certain sites on the salivary gland. Chromosomes puff formation is taken as an indication of the activation of a certain gene or set of genes. This is one piece of evidence that certain genes may be activated by hormones.", "images": ["images/F21-0542_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F21-0542.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The hormones involved are ecdysone and juvenile hormone.

{"question": "An experimenter crossed a stock of corn homozygous for the linked recessive genes colorless (c), shrunken (s) and waxy (w) to a stock homozygous for the dominant alleles of these genes (C, S, W) and then backcrossed the F_1 plants to the homozygous recessive stock. The progeny were as follows: Phenotype (all are -c-s-w) Number 1 CSW 17,959 2 csw 17,699 3 Csw 2,009 4 cSW 2,024 5 CSw 4,455 6 csW 4,654 7 CsW 288 8 cSw 312 49,400 Draw a linkage map for the three genes.", "solution": "In order to draw a linkage map for the three genes, we must determine the distances between the genes in map units and the order of the genes on the chromo-some. Let us first determine the parental type. We know that since the F_1 plants resulted from a cross between a homozygous dominant (CC, SS, WW) and a homozygous recessive (cc, ss, ww) parent, they are heterozygous (CcSsWw). They were crossed with homozygous recessive plants (ccssww) Therefore the parental types are CcSsWs ( 1 ) and ccssww ( 2 ). The other six phenotypes are recombinants. To determine the distances between the genes, let us determine the RF for two genes at a time. Consider a cross-over anywhere between c and S. The number or recombinants (from F_2) = 2009 3 + 2024 4 + 288 7 + 312 8 = 4633. RF = (4633) / (49400) = 0.094 An RF of 0.094 gives a separation of 9.4 units between C and S. Consider a cross-over between S and W. The number of recombinants = 4455 5 + 4654 6 + 288 7 + 312 8 = 9709. RF = (9709) / (49400) = 0.196 That is, S and W are 19.6 units apart. Consider a cross-over between C and Wx. The number of recombinants = 2009 3 + 2024 4 + 4455 5 + 4654 6 = 13142. RF = (13142) / (49400) = 0.266 That is, C and W are 26.6 map units apart. To construct a linkage map, we choose randomly C and Wx as our reference points. S is 19.6 units away from w. The only way s can be 9.4 units away from C is for s to lie between C and W. On a genetic map, we have: However, the sum of the map distances between C' and S, and between S and W = 9.4 + 19.6 or 29.0 unit. This sum is greater than the distance between C and W (26.6 units). How do we explain this discrepancy? The explanation lies in the fact that more than one cross-over can occur between two genes, expecially if they are far apart. In this case, there is a cross-over between C and S and between S and W making two cross-overs between C and Wx. Diagrammatically, this can be rep- resented as follows: The result of two cross-overs between two genes is called a double recombinant. Since single cross-overs are quite infrequent, the frequency of double recombinants is even lower. The double recombinants are usually identified by their lowest frequency in the F_2. From F_2, the number of double recombinants = 288 7 312 8 or 600. Percentage of = [(number of double cross-over)/(total number of progeny) \u00d7 100 = [(600)/(49400)] \u00d7 100 = 1.2% The cause of the discrepancy between the map distances can be traced to the fact that when we calculate the RF between C and S and between S and W, we include the number of double recombinants into the number of recombinants each time. (Refer to previous calculations). However, when we determine the RF between C and W, we neglect the double cross-overs because they do not affect the parental types CW and cw. To compensate for the double cross-overs, we have to add to the map distance between C and W twice the perc.entage of double cross- overs. This is because each double cross-over is the result of two separate events, a cross between c and S and a cross between S and W. In essence, four more crosses have occured between c and w that had not been considered before, having a total frequency of: (288)/(49400) (between c and s)(288)/(49400)(between s and w) (312)/(+49400) (between c and s)(312)/(+49400) (between c and w) or 2 \u00d7 1. 2. Thus the distance between c and w is 26.6 + (2 \u00d7 1.2) or 29.0 units. After the correction is made, everything falls in place. Note that the recombination frequency between each pair of genes is increased by the frequency of the double cross-overs.", "images": ["images/F25-0679_files/image002.jpg", "images/F25-0679_files/image004.jpg", "images/F25-0679_files/image006.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F25-0679.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The distances between the genes are 9.4 units between C and S, 19.6 units between S and W, and 29.0 units between C and W."}

{"question": "What cell components typically found in aeucaryoticcell are missing from a bacterial (procaryotic) cell?", "solution": "Cells are classified as eukaryotic or prokaryotic.

Prokaryotes include all bacteria including thecyanobacteria(blue-green algae), whereas eukaryotes include theprotistan, fungal, animal and plant cells. The most obvious difference between bacteria andeucaryotesis the absence of the nuclear membrane in bacteria. The DNA of the bacterial cell is generally confined to a specific area but this region is not enclosed by a membrane. In addition, proteins, such as thehistonesofeucaryotic cells , are not found in association with bacterial DNA. Another distinctive feature is that during replication of the bacterial nuclear region, the mitotic spindle apparatus is not seen.

{"question": "Small amounts of cyanide can kill a person. Why is cyanide such a deadly poison?", "solution": "Cyanide acts by inhibiting the final reaction of the respiratory chain, shutting it off and preventing the energy extraction process from taking place. Normally, reduced cytochrome a, the final element in the respiratory chain, would be reoxidized by oxygen, but since cyanide inhibits this from occuring, the whole chain is shut off as the intermediate acceptors are all converted to the reduced condition. Consequently, there is a severe decrease in the amount of ATP that can be produced fox life processes, leading to the death of the victim. Hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide have similar effects at this site. Other poisons block either of the first two sites. Looking at the electron transport chain it may not be obvious how the inhibition of the reoxidation of reduced cytochrome a can shut off the entire respiratory chain. Cyanide blocks ATP formation of the third site of ATP synthesis in the chain. However, this does not mean that ATP production still goes on as usual at the first and second site. Some ATP may be produced immedi-ately after cyanide enters the electron transport chain, but eventually production stops. ATP production ceases because of the inability of the intermediate acceptors to oxidize NADH. Inhibition by cyanide generates an accumulation of reduced cytochrome a by preventing its oxidation. Since cytochrome a is in a reduced state, it cannot oxidize its neighbor, reduced cytochrome c. This leads to an accumulation of reduced cytochrome c and then c_1, which, being unable to oxidize cytochrome b, prevents the formation of ATP at the second site. Of more importance is the \"backing up\" of reduced states towards the beginning of the chain leading even-tually to the reduction of all intermediate acceptors. These reduced intermediates cannot accept electrons; ATP formation in the respiratory chain requires inter-mediates to receive electrons which are liberated going from a reduced state to an oxidized state.

{"question": "How can one demonstrate that amino acids are used tobuild proteinsin cells, while the proteins already in the cell are usedin catabolism?", "solution": "One way of following the path of the amino acids is by a process calledautoradiography. We can make amino acids radioactive by the incorporationof radioactive isotopes such as tritium (^3H) or carbon-14. We canthen inject theselabelledamino acids into cells in tissue culture, and notechanges in the radioactive level. This is done by exposing the cells to anauto-radiographicemulsion, which upon exposure to any radioactivity in thecells, produces small grains visible microscopically. If we givelabelled aminoacids to the cells in culture and we look for radioactivity at successiveintervals, we should initially see an increase in the number of grainsas thelabelledamino acids are used to build proteins. As time progresses, the amount of radioactive protein should remain dynamically stable: as protein is broken down, new protein is synthesized. If we cease providingthe cells withlabelledamino acids and give them unlabelled aminoacids instead, the amount of radioactive protein in the cells will decreaseand eventually disappear as radioactive protein is degraded and excreted. The disappearance of radioactive protein indicates that protein isbeingcatabolized.

{"question": "Calculate the number of electrons that can be removed from metallic cesium with the energy required to remove one electron from an isolated cesium atom. Assume the following: the ionization potential of Cs = 3.89eV, h = 6.63 \u00d7 10^-34 J sec, and Cs metal is sensitive to red light of 700 nm.", "solution": "This problem entails the understanding of the photoelectric effect. The photoelectric effect states that when one shines light of a given frequency on a metallic material, electrons will be emitted. The equation: E =hv(where E = energy, v = frequency, and h = Planck's constant) determines the amount of energy produced by a given frequency of light. The ionization potential is the amount of energy needed to cause the electrons to be ejected from the metal. To solve this problem, there-fore , one must calculate how much energy is present in light with a wavelength of 700 nm and then compare this to the ionization potential of a Cs atom. It is given that the wavelength of the light is 700 nm. The frequency of this light is equal to speed of light/wavelength = (3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) / 700 \u00d7 10^-9 m. Thus, E = (6.63 \u00d7 10^-34 J sec) [(3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) / (700 \u00d7 10^-9 m)] = 2.84 \u00d7 10^-19 J/photon 1eV= 1.60 \u00d7 10^-19 J. The ionization energy is 3.89eVor (3.89eV) (1.60 \u00d7 10^-19 J/eV) = 6.22 \u00d7 10^-19 J. Because Cs is sensitive to light with a wavelength of 700 nm, one photon of this light flashed on the metal Cs will cause 1 electron to be emitted from the Cs. Therefore, the number of electrons emitted when 6.22 \u00d7 10^-19 J, (the ionization potential of an isolated Cs atom), is added to the metallic system is found by dividing 6.22 \u00d7 10^-19 J by 2.84 \u00d7 10^-19 J no. of electrons emitted = [(6 22 \u00d7 10^-19 J) / (2.84 \u00d7 10^-19 J)] = 2.2 electrons Therefore, the maximum number of electrons that can be emitted is 2.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E18-0691.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "2"}
{"question": "What is the lowest frequency of the standing sound wave that can be set up between walls that are separated by 25 ft?", "solution": "A sinusoidal wave that maintains its overall shape between two termination points is called a standing wave. Its amplitude does change with time. For such a wave, the end points have zero amplitude at all times. Zero amplitude points are called nodes and occur every half wavelength. The wave of lowest frequency has the longest wave-length. For a given distance L, the standing wave of longest wavelength has \\lambda = 2L with the only nodes occurring at the termination points.

Explain (a) why the freezing point was not altered substantially by a change in pressure, and (b) the paradox of water freezing and boiling at the same temperature.", "solution": "To solve this problem, you want to consider what would alter the temperature of any phase change and see if the condition exists in this case. The temperature of any phase transition is affected by pressure only because of the accompanying volume change. Since the difference in density between solid and liquid is usually small, as compared to liquid and gas, a pressure change will not alter to any significant degree the freezing point, since the volume change will be small. Thus, the boiling point was altered, but not the freezing point. The paradox of both the boiling point and freezing point being at the same point can be explained by a discussion of the triple point. At this point, some molecules are going from liquid to solid and others from solid to liquid, and similarly for the gas-liquid and liquid-solid transformations. An equilibrium is established when an equal number of molecules are going each way in all three processes. Thus, at the triple point, you have a set of conditions in which all three states may exist in equilibrium with each other. The freezing and boiling points, when at the same tem-perature, suggest such an equilibrium.

{"question": "Give qualitative explanation for the observed splitting of the ground state energy of the hydrogen atom in the presence of a magnetic field.", "solution": "This phenomenon is called Zeeman splitting, after the Dutch physicist Pieter Zeeman who first discovered the effect in 1896. Consider an electron moving in the ground state orbital of a hydrogen atom and describing a circular orbit (labelled \"O\" in the diagram). This motion will give rise to an angular momentum vector L^\\rightarrow directed along the axis of rotation. In the presence of a magnetic field H^\\rightarrow, the angular momentum vector will precess about the magnetic field axis. Now, since the angular momentum of an electron must be quantized, the projection of L^\\rightarrow on to H^\\rightarrow (that is, the com-ponent of the vector L^\\rightarrow along axis H^\\rightarrow) must also be quantized. From quantum theory, we know that this projection must take on values which are integral multiples (positive, negative, or zero) of h/2\\pi, where h is Planck's constant. These in-tegers are the possible values of the magnetic quantum number, m. For the hydrogen atom, the magnetic quantum number can take on the values m = - 1, 0, + 1. Thus, we observe three lines for hydrogen, in a magnetic field. The high energy line corresponds to the case where the projection of L^\\rightarrow onto H^\\rightarrow has the same di-rection as H^\\rightarrow (m = 1), the intermediate line occurs when L^\\rightarrow and H^\\rightarrow are perpendicular and the projection of L^\\rightarrow onto H^\\rightarrow is thus zero (m = 0) , and the low energy line corresponds to the case where the projection of L^\\rightarrow onto H^\\rightarrow has the opposite direction of H^\\rightarrow (m = - 1).", "images": ["images/E18-0683_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E18-0683.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Zeeman splitting"}

AC + CB = 3000 (AC/CS) = tan 30 (CB/CS) = tan 60 AC + CB = CS (tan 30 + tan 60) CS = [(AC + CB)/(tan 30 + tan 60)] = [(3000 ft)/(0.577 + 1.732)] = 1310 ft since tan 30 = 0.577 tan 60 = 1.732 (b) In actual fact the sound waves are refracted at a depth of 200 ft.

The third assignment statement contains alternation - the expression where different patterns are separated by symbol \\vert (with at least one blank on each side). The value of the expression is a pattern structure that matches any string specified by any of the alternative patterns. The first alternative pattern in the third statement is ''- a regular blank, while the second pattern includes a few new features. The first of them is a primitive function ANY. ANY and the opposite function NOTANY are primitive functions whose values are pattern structures that match single characters. ANY matches any character appearing in its argument, following the function in parentheses. NOTANY matches any character not appearing in its argument. Thus the pattern structure ANY (LETTER) matches any letter of the alphabet (the structure ANY('ABCD...XYZ') would have the same meaning). How ANY LETTER then concatenates with another alternative structure needs a detailed explanation. The SPAN function returns a matched run of characters, included in concatenated strings LETTER and DIGIT (any other character met with indicates the end of the run). Matching a pattern structure against a subject string, in SNOBOL IV, is done by a procedure called the SCANNER. The scanner has a pointer (control) called the CURSOR which is positioned to the left of the character that the scanner must match. As the scanner matches one by one the characters of the string, the cursor correspondingly moves to the right. These concepts are important in understanding the function of the next variable of the second alternative structure in line 3 - @N. The unary operator @ is called the cursor position operator. At any moment of the pattern matching process, it assigns an integer, representing the cursor position at that moment, to a variable following it (in our case, N). For example, in statement 'EXAMPLE' @JUNK 'L' The cursor, at first, is located to the left of E. No match occurs; the value 1 is assigned to the variable JUNK, and the cursor moves to X. The process goes on until the cursor hits L. By that time JUNK has the value of 5. Letter L matches, execution goes to the next statement, and variable JUNK is stored with value 5. Thus, in our problem, N indicates the position of the cursor after the scanner matched all characters of the first string on the card up to the first blank. In other words, N counts the number of characters in the label. Next comes the comparison of N. The unary operator \\textasteriskcentered (asterisk) postpones the evaluation of its operand. Thus, LE(N,8) is an unevaluated expression until it appears as part of a pattern LABEL in statement 6. This way the expression is evaluated only when needed. An alternative expression for concatenation in the second part of statement 3 is a string NULL which, in SNOBOL IV indicates a string of length zero. It is different from the strings 'O' and '', each of which has a length one. The NULL string consists of no characters, no blanks, no length. A blank finishes the pattern. It is now possible to follow through the function of the pattern LABEL in the sixth statement. If the statement on the input card starts with a blank, the pattern matches at once, and the execution returns to the previous statement CARD = INPUT :F(END), reading in the next card. If, however, the statement on the card starts with a letter, the characters following that letter are examined. All the characters (including the initial letter) are counted up to the first blank (specified in pattern LABEL by the blank at the end). Also all those characters have to belong either to LETTER or to DIGIT. If, in fact, the cursor hits a symbol which belongs to neither of those two strings, the matching fails, and the card is printed out as having an invalid label. Meanwhile, the integer produced by the counting procedure is assigned to N. If all the characters are legitimate, N is compared with 8. If N appears to be less than or equal to 8, the match succeeds, and the next card is considered. In case N is greater than 8, the match fails, and the card is printed out. If the first letter is followed by no other characters (NULL string), just a blank, the match succeeds, and the next card is considered. The program terminates after consideration of the last card.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G15-0390.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "LETTER = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' DIGIT ='0123456789' LABEL = ''\\vert ANY(LETTER) (SPAN(LETTER DIGIT)@N \\textasteriskcenteredLE(N,8) +\\vertNULL) '' \\vert &NCHOR = 1 RCARD = INPUT:F(END) CARDLABEL:S(R) OUTPUT = CARD:(R) END"}

Let the electric field due to the charge dq of each segment dl be resolved into a vertical and a horizontal component (see fig. B). From the symmetry of the hoop about its center, the horizontal components of the electric field due to the charges on any two segments dl on opposite ends of the center will cancel one another. The vertical components are in the same direction and add algebraically. The direction, then, of the total E^\\ding{217} due to all pairs of segments dl at opposite ends of the center, will be vertically up-ward, or along the positive z-axis. Thus at the center of the hoop where there is no vertical component of the electric field due to the charge dq on a segment dl, E is zero and at the position where z = 0.4 m, using (1) E_0.4 = [9 \u00d7 10^9 N \\bullet m^2 \\bullet C^-2 \u00d7 0.2 \u00d7 10^-12 C \u00d7 0.4 m] / [\\surd{(0.3 m)^2 + (0.4 m)^2}]^3 = [0.2 \u00d7 10^-12 C \u00d7 0.4 m \u00d7 9 \u00d7 10^9 N \\bullet m^2 \\bullet c^-2] / [(0.5)^3 m^3] = 5.76 \u00d7 10^-3 V \\bullet m^-1. Note that when z is positive, E is positive, and when z is negative, E is negative. The direction of E^\\ding{217} is thus always along the axis away from the hoop. The electric intensity E is zero when z = 0 and also when z = \\infty; E must therefore pass through a maximum value somewhere between these two points.

{"question": "A typical bacterial cell has a cell wall and plasma membrane. If the cell wall is removed by treatment withlysozyme, an enzyme that selectively dissolves the cell wall material, will the bacteria live? Explain. What is the biochemicaldifference between the cell walls of bacteria, and plants?", "solution": "The main function of the bacterial cell wall is to provide a rigid framework or casing which supports and protects the bacterial cell from osmotic disruption. Most bacteria live in a medium which is hypotonic relative to the bacterial protoplasm: i.e., the bacterial protoplasm is more concentrated than the medium, and water tends to enter the cell. If intact, the cell wall provides a rigid casing, which prevents the cell from swelling and bursting. If the cell wall were destroyed, water would enter the cell and cause osmoticlysis(bursting). If the bacterium is placed in a medium which has the same osmotic pressure as the bacterial cell contents, osmotic disruption would not occur when the cell wall was dissolved. A bacterium devoid of its cell wall is called a protoplast. Pro-toplasts can live in an isotonic medium, (medium having equal osmotic pressure as the bacterial protoplast).If the bacterium was placed in a hypertonic medium, waterwould leave the cell andplasmolysis(shrinkage) would ensue. The cell wall varies in thickness from 100 to 250 \\AA (an angstrom, \\AA, is 10^\\rule{1em}{1pt}10 meter) and may account for as much as 40% of the dry weight ofthe cell. While the cell wall ineucaryotesis composed of cellulose, in bacteria , the cell wall is composed ofinsoluablepep-tidoglycan. Peptidoglycan consists of sugars (N-aceylglucosamineand N- acetylmuramic acid) and amino acids, includingdiaminopinelicacid, an amino acid unique to bacteria. In gram-negative bacteria, the peptidoglycan constitutes a much smaller fraction of the wall component than it does in gram-positive bacteria. The higher lipid content in the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria accounts for the differences in gram- staining . The plasma membrane, a thin covering immediately beneath the cell wall, is too fragile to provide the support needed by the cell.

{"question": "What is meant by a hydrostatic skeleton? In which organisms is such a structure found?", "solution": "Cnidarians (coelenterata) such as hydra, flatworms such as planaria , and annelids like the earth worms all move by the same basic principle of antagonistic muscles. They have no hardexo- or endo - skeleton to anchor the ends of their muscles. Instead the noncompressible fluid contents of the body cavity serve as a hydrostatic skeleton. Such animals typically have a set of circular muscles, the contraction of which decreases the diameter and increases the length of the animal, and a set of antagonistic longitudinal muscles, which, when contracted, decrease the length and increase the diameter of the animal. As an example, the leech is often used. The leech attaches its posterior end to the substrate by means of a sucker, extends its body forward by contraction of the circular muscles, attaches its front end by a sucker, and then detaches the posterior end and draws it forward by contraction of the longitudinal muscles. Note that circular and longitudinal muscle are found in man: the smooth muscle lining his hollow visceral organs, for example. By alternate contractions of each muscle layer, peristaltic waves propel the contents along the hollow organ. For instance, this occurs in the esopha-gus, intestines, oviducts,ureters, etc. The relatively soft internal tissues of solid-bodied animals like the leech can function as a hydrostatic skeleton only to some extent. More active wormlike animals, like the annelids, have evolved segmented bodies in which fluid is contained in a partitioned series of cavities. In addition to segmentation of the body cavity, there is a segmentation of the musculature; the fact that each segment of the body has its circular and longi-tudinal muscles makes possible effective use of the compartmented hydrostatic skeleton. The arrangement of the hyd-rostatic skeleton allows for peristaltic movements down the length of the organism. This aids the organism in burrowing. Some marine worms have additional diagonally arranged muscles that permit more complex movements- of the body and thepaddlelike parapodia that extend laterally from the body wall. Many marine worms live in tubes and the movements of theparapodiaare important not only in locomotion, but in moving currents of water laden with oxygen and nutrients through these tubes.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F19-0487.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "A hydrostatic skeleton is the noncompressible fluid contents of the body cavity that serve as a skeleton in organisms like Cnidarians, flatworms, and annelids."}

The change in Ca++ concentration is 0.0667\\Elzbar x; the change in Sr++ is 0.0667\\Elzbar 0.032 x. To find the final [SO--_4 ], note that one SO--_4 , is lost for each it Ca++ that reacts and one SO--_4 , is lost for eachSr++ that reacts. Thus the change in [SO--_4 ] is the sum of the changes in [Ca++] and [Sr++]. Thus, change in [SO--_4 ] = (0.0667\\Elzbar x) + (0.0667\\Elzbar .032x) = (0.1334\\Elzbar 1.032x).

{"question": "Define top-down structured programming. Also define bottom-up structured programming. What importance does each of these terms have in relation to the computer implementation of an algorithm?", "solution": "The top-down design technique is the offspring of the idea of refinement. This technique requires that the programmer define the algorithm coarsely, in plain English or with some sort of code. Next, a structured language or a flow chart should be used to explain the parts of the algorithm that need greater clarification. This process of writing more and more detailed descriptions continues until the algorithm is sufficiently documented. Thereafter, the translation of the algorithm into a standard computer language, such as COBOL or FORTRAN, becomes a simple mechanical procedure. This technique is especially useful when a team of programmers is working on a specific problem. If each programmer is assigned a small part of a large task, the parts can be combined easily by assembling the codes from each part. If the modular programming rule of one-entry- one- exit per module is followed as well, the sections of code become like interchangeable parts of a machine. Any other programmer can pick up your section of code and substitute it into a program that needs what you have written. Bottom-up design is just the opposite. It refers to the creation of the program in a highly detailed fashion before coding or documentation is begun. This is sometimes bad practice when writing programs because the programmer is prone to miss important details. Also, it is both time-saving and economical to iron out errors in the coding stage before typing out a program for computer execution. This idea of program- first, code-second may be used if one wants to debug a program. By looking at a program first, you might be able to find syntactical errors that cause problems. After this is done, then a look at the code allows you to debug any logical errors.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/ComputerScience/G08-0169.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Top-down design technique requires the programmer to define the algorithm coarsely and then refine it, while bottom-up design refers to the creation of the program in a highly detailed fashion before coding or documentation is begun."}
{"question": "The electric field outside of an infinite cylindrically symmetrical charge distribution is equivalent to the field due to an infinite line charge of equal linear charge density.", "solution": "First, we compute the field due to a cylindrical shell of charge. We note that the field must be radial since no other direction is preferred. We erect as a Gaussian surface, a cylinder, of radius r (r > R) and height l, concentric to the shell. (See figure (a)). By Gauss' law (since E is constant along any cylinder concentric to the axis): \\int E^\\ding{217} \\textbullet dA^\\ding{217} = 4\\piq, 2\\pirlE = 4\\pi(s\\piRl\\sigma) where \\sigma = q/area is the surface change density of the shell. We note that since the field is radial, the flux through the top and bottom of the Gaussian cylinder is zero. Thus: E = 4\\piR\\sigma/r = 2 [{2\\piR (q/2\\piRl)}/r] = [2(q/l)]/r = 2\\lambda/r where \\lambda = q/l is the linear charge density. This formula holds for a cylindrically symmetrical charge distribution since we can consider such a configuration as the superposition of many cylindrical shells of charge density \\lambda_i , i = 1, 2, 3,...

Figure (b) depicts an infinite line of charge of linear charge density \\lambda, with a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius r and height l, surrounding it.

{"question": "Using the pedigree below, determine the method of inheritance of the trait and, as far as possible, fill in the genotypes of each individual. Assume that the trait is recessive.", "solution": "Let B represent the normal allele and b rep-resent the allele for Mongolian spot. Using the system established in the previous question, we can say that P_1, F_1,2, F1,3,F_1,4- ,F_1,5 ,F_2,2 and F_1,4 (see pedigree) are genotypically bb, because they all express the recessive Mongolian spot trait. Since all of the progeny of P_1 and P_2 carry the trait, the genetic make-up of P_2 who does not express the trait but must carry the recessive gene, is Bb. In the cross between F_1,1 and F_1,2, we see that one of their children (F_2,3) shows the trait. Since F_1,2 must have contributed one recessive gene, the other re-cessive gene must have come from F_1,1. But F_1,-1 is normal, so her genotype must be Bb. F_2,1 is also Bb. To determine the genotypes of F_3 and P_4, we have to examine the cross between F_1,5 and F_1,6. One of the offspring in this cross (F_2,4) shows Mongolian spots. This implies that both parents must have a copy of b. We already know that F_1,5 is bb. Therefore F_1,6 must be Bb, since he is normal F_2,3 is also Bb because he can receive only the recessive allele from F_1,5. Since F_1,6 is he-terozygous, one of his parents must have allele b. We cannot assume which parent carries the b allele, because the information is not available for us to be certain. Conceivably, both parents can be Bb, the number of their progeny being too small to necessarily include a homozygous recessive. Or one parent may be BB, in which case all their offspring would show the normal phenotype. The genotype of F_1,7 can thus be either BB or Bb.

{"question": "Three moles of a diatomic perfect gas are allowed to expand at constant pressure. The initial volume is 1.3 m^3 and the initial temperature is 350\\textdegreeK. If 10,000 Joules are transferred to the gas as heat, what are the final volume and temperature?", "solution": "Since the process of heat (Q) addition occurs at constant pressure, we may write Q = \\mu C_p(T_2 - T_1) where \\mu is the number of moles of gas in the system, C_p is the molar specific heat at constant pressure, and T_2 - T_1 is the temperature difference between the 2 equilibrium states [see figures (a) and (b)]. Now, Q is given (10,000 Joules), as is \\mu and T. Hence, we may solve for T_2 as a function of C_p. If we can calcul-ate the value of C_p from kinetic theory, we will have obtained T_2. We now perform the appropriate calculation. Consider a gas moving from one equilibrium state to another, via some thermodynamic process. We assume that the process occurs at constant volume. Using the First Law of Thermodynamics, we obtain \u2206U = Q - W(1) Here, \u2206U is the change in internal energy of the gas during the process, and Q and W are the heat added to and the work done by the gas, respectively, during the process. Writing (1) in differential form dU = dQ - dW(2) In general, the element of work done by the gas in an expansion is, by definition dW = F^\\ding{217} \\textbullet ds^\\ding{217} where F^\\ding{217} is the force the gas exerts on the piston [see figure (a)] and ds^\\ding{217} is the element of distance the piston moves during the expansion. Since F^\\ding{217} acts perpendi-cular to the face of the piston (that is, F^\\ding{217} and ds^\\ding{217} are parallel), we obtain dW = F ds(3) But F may be written in terms of the pressure p, that the gas exerts on the piston face of area A F = pA Using this in (3) dW = p ds A = p dV where dV is the differential change in volume of the gas during the expansion. Substituting this in (2), we find dU = dQ - p dV(4) Applying this equation to the above-mentioned isovolumic process, we obtain dU = dQ since dV = 0. By defintion, however dQ = \\mu C_v dT where C_v is the molar specific heat of the gas at constant volume, and dT is the differential temperature change the gas experiences due to the addition of heat dQ. Then dU = \\mu C_v dT(5) We now assume that the change in internal energy of a gas is only a function of the temperature differ-ence experienced by the gas. Then, no matter what thermodynamic process the gas experiences, (5) holds. Consider next an isobaric thermodynamic process. Again, we apply (4) dU = dQ - p dV(4) Since the process occurs at constant pressure, dQ = \\mu C_p dT(6) where C_p is the molar heat capacity at constant pressure. Furthermore, from the ideal gas law pV = \\muRT If p is constant, p (dV/dT) = \\muR orp dV = \\mu R dT(7) Using (6), (7), and (5) in (4) \\mu C_v dT = \\mu C_p dT - \\mu R dT orC_p = C_v + R(8) Equation (8) relates the molar specific heat at constant pressure to the molar specific heat at constant volume. All the derivations up to now have been necessary in order to obtain certain relations involving molar specific heats, namely equations (5) and (8). We now turn to an examination of the internal energy of a diatomic gas. Each method of energy storage of a diatomic molecule is called a degree of freedom. If we view a diatomic molecule as being dumbell-shaped, then it has 5 degrees of freedom [see figures (c) and (d)] . The molecule may move translationally in 3 directions (x, y, z) with 3 kinetic energies [(1/2) mv^2_x, (1/2) mv^2_y, (1/2) mv^2_z). Furthermore, it may rotate about 3 axes (x, y, z), again, with 3 kinetic energies [(1/2)I_x\\omega^2_x, (1/2)I_y\\omega^2_y, (1/2)I_z\\omega^2_z]. However, the rotational kinetic energy about the y axis is negligible [see figure (d)] because I_y < < I_x , I_z . Hence a diatomic molecule has 5 independent methods of energy absorption, or 5 degrees of freedom. Notice one important fact: each of these kinetic energy terms has the same form, mathematical-ly. That is, they are all of the form of a positive constant times the square of a variable which has a domain extending from - \\infty to + \\infty. The theorem of equipartition of energy tells us that, when Newtonian mechanics holds, and the number of gas particles is large, each term of this form has the same average value per molecule, namely, (1/2) kT. In other words, each degree of freedom of a gas molecule contributes an amount (1/2) kT to the internal energy of the gas. For a diatomic gas, then, the internal energy per molecule is U_i = 5 (1/2)(kT) = (5/2) kT The internal energy for \\mu moles of molecules is U = \\muN_0U_i = (5/2) \\mukN_0T = (5/2) \\muRT Using this in (5), we may solve for C_v (1/\\mu)[d{(5/2) \\muRT}/{dT}] = C_v C_v = (5/2)R Using this fact in (8) C_p = C_v + R = [(5 R)/2] + R = (7/2)R Getting back to the original problem, use this value of C_p in the first equation Q = \\mu C_p(T_2 - T_1) = (7/2)\\muR(T_2 - T_-1) orT_2 = T_1 + Q/[(7/2)\\muR] = 350\\textdegreeK + [10,000 Joules] / [(7/2)(3 moles)(8.31Joules/mole \\textdegreeK)] T_2 = 350\\textdegreeK + 114\\textdegreeK = 464\\textdegreeK T_2 = 350\\textdegreeK + 114\\textdegreeK = 464\\textdegreeK Using the ideal gas law for the 2 equilibrium states pV_1 = \\muRT_1 pV_2 = \\muRT_2 orV_2/V_1 = T_2/T_1 whence V_2 = (T_2/T_1)V_1 = (464/350)1.3 m^3 = 1.72 m^3.", "images": ["images/D15-0534_files/image002.jpg", "images/D15-0534_files/image004.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Physics/D15-0534.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "T_2 = 464\textdegreeK, V_2 = 1.72 m^3"}

In either case, if the processor determines that it has encountered an integer, the sign of this integer is indicated by using the leftmost bit of the 2 or 4 byte field. If the integer is positive this bit is zero, if it is negative the bit is one. The computers store packed decimal numbers by placing two decimal digits in each byte (8 bits) field. This is done for all the bytes of the field with the exception of the rightmost. For this byte, the rightmost four bits in-dicate the sign of the number.

{"question": "What factors affect the rate of transpiration?", "solution": "A number of different factors affect the rate of transpiration. The most important of these is temperature. Because temperature is a measurement of the average molecular kinetic energy, a high temperature heating up the plant body will provide the water molecules within the leaves with increased internal energy, and many of them may soon gainadequate kinetic energy to enter the gaseous phase and escape into the atmosphere . The higher the temperature rises, the greater will be the rate of transpiration, all other factors remaining constant. Plants of the desert, thus , must adapt some mechanisms to slow down water loss due to rapid evapo-ration by the hot desert air. Humidity is a second important factor. Water is lost much more slowly into air already laden with water vapor. This is why plants growing in shady forests, where the humidity is generally high, typically spread large luxuriant leaf surfaces since their chief problem is getting enough sunlight , not losing water. In contrast, plants of grasslands or other exposed areas often have narrow leaves and relatively little total leaf surface , since they are able to get sufficient light but are constantly in danger of excessive water loss. Air currents also affect the rate of transpiration. Wind blows away the water vapor from leaf surfaces, allowing more vapor molecules to escape from the leaf surface. If the air is humid, wind may actually decrease the transpiration rate by cooling the leaf, but if the breeze is dry, evaporation is increased and the trans-piration rate is greatly enhanced. Leaves of plants growing in windy, exposed areas are often hairy. These hairs are believed to protect the leaf surface from wind action by trapping a layer of air saturated with water vapor over the surface of the leaf.

If 0.500 moles of SO_2 are introduced at constant temperature, what will be the new concentrations of reactants and products when equilibrium is re-established?", "solution": "LeChatelier'sprinciple states: If a stress is placed on a system in equilibrium, whereby the equilibrium is altered, that change will take place which tends to relieve or neutralize the effect of the added stress. Thus, in this reaction, if more SO_2 is added more NO and SO_3 will be formed. If stress is placed on the left side of the equation, the reaction will be forced to the right (and vice versa). One can determine the equilibrium constant (Keq) for this reaction by using the concentrations of the original mixture. The equilibrium constant is defined: Keq= {[NO][SO_3]} / {[NO_2 ][SO_2]} where [ ] indicate concentrations. Solving forKeqwith [NO] = 2.00[NO_2] = 0.100 [SO_3 ] = 0.600[SO_2] = 0.300 , one obtains Keq= {(2.00) (0.600)} / {(0.100)(0.300)} = 40.0 . One can solve for the new concentrations by using theKeq. From Le Chatelier'sprinciple, one knows that when S0_2 is added to this mixture, the amounts of NO and SO_3 will increase. Let x = the number of moles by which NO and SO_3 will increase. For each mole of SO_3 and NO formed, one mole of SO_2 and one mole of NO_2 will react, thus the new concentrations of these components will be equal to the original concentrations less x moles.

What is theisoelectricpoint of this molecule (the pH at which the number of positive charges on the molecule equals the number of negative charges).", "solution": "We will approach this problem by considering the equilibrium constants k_1 and k_2. For the first reaction, k_1 is equal to k_1 = {[H^+][NH_3CH_2COO^-]} / [^+NH_3CH_2COOH] and for the secondreation, k_2 is equal to k_2 = {[H^+][NH_2CH_2COO^-]} / [^+NH_3CH_2COO^-] If we take the product of these two constants, the concentration of isoelectricspecies ^+NH_3CH_2COO-cancels out, giving k_1k_2 = ({[H^+][NH_3CH_2COO^-]} / [^+NH_3CH_2COOH]) \u00d7 ({[H^+][NH_2CH_2COO^-]} / [^+NH_3CH_2COO^-]) = {[H^+]^2[NH_2CH_2COO^-]} / [^+NH_3CH_2COOH] At theisoelectricpoint, the concentrations of all charged species are equal, that is [NH_2CH_2COO^-] = [^+NH_3CH_2COOH].

{"question": "Describe the various land biomes that are usually encounteredby a traveler going from the equator to the arcticpolar ice cap.", "solution": "In the equatorial regions of several continents (Africa, Asia, and South America) are tropical rain forests with enormous trees (See figure, problem28-15). The interlocking canopy of leaves blocks out the sun and allowsonly dim light to penetrate. As a result, the ground is sparsely coveredwith small plants. The canopy also interrupts the direct fall of the plentifulrain, but water drips from it to the forest floor much of the time, evenwhen it is not raining. It also shields the lower levels from wind and hencegreatly reduces the rate of evaporation. The lower levels of theforst areconsequently very humid. Temperatures near the forest floor are nearlyconstant. The pronounced differences in conditions at different levels within sucha forest result in a striking degree of vertical stratification. Many speciesof animals and epiphytic plants (plants growing on large trees) occuronly in the canopy, while others occur only in the middle strata and stillothers occur only on the forest floor. Decomposition of fallen leaves anddead wood is so rapid that humus is even missing in spots on the floor. The diversity of life here is the greatest found anywhere on earth. In asingle square mile of the richest tropical rain forests, hundreds of speciesof trees, hundreds more of birds, butterflies, reptiles and amphibians, and dozens of species of mammals make their habitat. Huge areas in both the temperate and tropical regions of the world arecovered by grassland biomes. These are typically areas with relatively lowtotal annual rainfall or uneven seasonal occurrence of rainfall. This typeof climate is unfavorable for forests but suitable for growth of grasses. Temperate and tropical grasslands are remarkably similar in appearance, althoughthe particular species they contain may be very different. In both cases, there are usually vast numbers of large herbivores, which often includethe ungulates (hoofed animals). Burrowing rodents orrodentlike animalsare also often common. North of the tropics, in the temperate regions of Europe and eastern North America, are deciduous forests. Small creepers and epiphytes such aslichens and mosses may be found, but they are not so conspicuous an inthe rain forests. There is richer vegetation on the ground below, which is oftencovered by a carpet of herbs. Such a forest may be called temperate deciduousforest. In those parts of the temperate zone where rainfall is abundantand the summers are relatively long and warm, the climax communitiesare frequently dominated by broad-leaved trees, whose leaveschange color in autumn then fall off in winter and grow back in the spring. North of the deciduous forest of temperate North America and Eurasia is a wide zone dominated by coniferous (cone-bearing) forests sometimesreferred to as the boreal forests. This is the taiga biome. Instead of being bushy-topped, the trees are mostly of the triangular Christmas-tree shape.The trees of the boreal forest are evergreens, cone-bearingand needle-leaved consisting mostly of spruce, fir, and tamarack. They branch over most of their height and are relatively close-packed. The land is dotted by lakes, ponds and bogs. The winters of thetaiga are very cold and during the warm summers, the subsoil thaws andvegetation flourishes. Moose, black bears, wolves, lynx, wolverines, martens, squirrels, and many smaller rodents are important in the taiga communities. Birds are abundant in summer. The territory of the boreal forest is hundreds of miles wide, but eventuallyit meets the completely treeless vegetation of the tundra. The tundrais the most continuous of the earth's biomes, forming a circular bandaround the North pole, interrupted only narrowly by the North Atlantic andthe Bearing Sea. The vegetation of the tundra resembles grassland butit is actually made up of a mixture of lichens, mosses, grasses, sedges andlow growing willows and other shrubs. There are numerous perennial herbs, which are able to withstand frequent freezing and which grow rapidlyduring the brief cool summers, often carpeting the tundra with brightlycolored flowers. A permanent layer of frozen soil lies a few inches toa few feet beneath the surface. It prevents the roots of trees and other deepgrowing plants from becoming established, and it slows the drainage ofsurface water. As a result, the flat portions of the tundra are dotted with shallowlakes and bogs, and the soil between them is exceptionally wet. Reindeer, lemmings, caribou, arctic wolves, foxes and hares are among theprincipal mammals, while polar bears are common on parts of the tundranear the coast. Vast numbers of birds,particularyshorebirds and waterfowl(ducks, geese, etc.), nest on the tundra in summer, but they are notpermanent inhabitants and migrate south for the winter. Insects are incrediblyabundant. In short, the tundra is far from being a barren lifeless land; but the number of different species is quite limited. The succession of biomes between the equator and the Arctic is roughlymirrored in the Southern Hemisphere, although the absence of largelandmasses makes the pattern less complete. There are also some otherbiomes that are more irregularly scattered about the world, but which havea distinctive form. These are the biomes of the desert regions and thesclerophylousbushlands. Thebushlands, common in the chaparral of California,maquisof theMediterranean and themalleeheath of Australia, are made up of differentspecies of plants, but have much in common. They have gnarled andtwisted, rough and thorny plants. The leaves tend to be dark and are hairy, leathery, or thickly cutinized. All grow in places with hot dry summersand relatively cool moist winters. A climatic pattern such as this israre and is always accompanied with vegetation of this form. In places whererainfall, is very low grasses cannot survive as the dominant vegetationand desert biomes occur.Desertsare subject to the most extremetemperature fluctuations of any biome. During the day they are exposedto intense sunlight, and the temperature of both air and soil may risevery high. But in the absence of the moderating influence of abundant vegetation, heat is rapidly lost at night, and a short while after sunset, searingheat has usually given way to bitter cold. Some deserts, such as partsof the Sahara, are nearly barren of vegetation, but more commonly thereare scattered drought-resistant shrubs and succulent plants that can storemuch water in their tissues. Most desert animals are active primarily atnight or during the brief periods in early morning and late afternoon whenthe heat is not so intense. Most of them show numerous remarkable physiologicaland behavioral adaptations for life in their hostile environment. We have thus seen that one moving North or South on theearth's surfacemay pass through a series of different biomes. The major biome typeshave been mentioned with the exception of the comparatively unproductivebiomes such as the polar ice caps. Ecologists often differ in theirclassifications of the major patches of the biosphere because the biomesare strictly defined by the elements put into them. The borders of thebiomes shift as we add orsubstractspecies. The point to remember is thatthe biomes seldom exist as sharply defined patches. They have broad borders, and the species that comprise them have weakly correlated geographical ranges.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F30-0784.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The various land biomes encountered from the equator to the arctic polar ice cap include tropical rain forests, grassland biomes, temperate deciduous forests, boreal forests or taiga, tundra, desert regions, and sclerophylous bushlands."}

{"question": "What are the importance of desmids, diatoms and dinoflagellates to man?", "solution": "Desmids, diatoms and dinoflagellates are all unicellular algae. Desmids are nonmotile, fresh-water green algae, commonly found in lakes and rivers. Desmids have symmetrical, curved, spiny or lacy bodies with a constriction in the middle of the cell. Under the microscope they look like snowflakes. Diatoms, members of Chrysophyta, are found in fresh and salt water. They have two shelled, siliceous cell walls and store food as leucosin and oil. The cell walls are ornamented with fine ridges, lines, and pores that are either radically symmetrical or bilaterally symmetrical along the long axis of the cell. Diatoms lack flagella, but are capable of slow, gliding motion. Dinoflagellates, the majority of the Pyrrophyta, are surrounded by a shell consisting of thick, interlocking plates. All are motile and have two flagella. A number of species lack chlorophyll. These are the heterotrophs which feed on particulate organic matter. Dinoflagellates are mainly marine organisms. All of these organisms play extremely important roles in aquatic food webs. Plankton is defined as small aquatic organisms floating or drifting near the surface. Phyto-plankton are photosynthetic autotrophs and the zooplankton are heterotrophs. Desmids are important freshwater phyto-plankton. Diatoms are the most abundant component of marine plankton (a gallon of sea water often contains one or two million diatoms). Diatoms are also found in abundance in many rivers. Dinoflagellates are second only to the diatoms as primary producers of organic matter in the marine en-vironment. Probably three quarters of all the organic matter in the world is synthesized by diatoms and dino-flagellates. In addition to the production of organic material, these algae have the primary responsibility for the continued production of molecular oxygen via photosyn-thesis. Respiration by animals utilizes oxygen. If the supply were not constantly being replenished, the oxygen on earth would be exhausted. Phytoplankton are essential to aquatic food chains; they are eaten by zooplankton, by invertebrates, and by some fish. The organisms which eat phytoplankton are in turn eaten by other organisms. Ultimately all aquatic life depends on the phytoplankton. Since terrestrial animals rely ultimately on the oceans, rivers, and lakes for a large part of their food source, the desmids, diatoms, and dinoflagellates are of crucial importance to land life as well. Diatoms are also important to man by virtue of their glasslike cell walls. When the cells die, their silica-impregnated shells sink to the bottom of the sea, and do not decay. These shells accumulate in large quantities and geologic uplifts bring the diatomaceous earth to the surface, where it is mined and used commercially. Diatomaceous earth is used as a fine abrasive in detergents, toothpastes, and polishes. It is also used as a filtering agent, and as a component in insulating bricks and soundproofing products. Diatoms utilize oils as reserve material, and it is widely believed that petroleum is derived from the oil of diatoms that lived in past geologic ages.", "images": ["images/F06-0163_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F06-0163.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Desmids, diatoms, and dinoflagellates play crucial roles in aquatic food webs, production of organic material, and oxygen production.

{"question": "Consider a point mass M at rest in a non-inertial frame, so that in this frame a = 0. The non-inertial frame rotates uniformly about an axis fixed with respect to an inertial frame. What is the acceleration of M with respect to an inertial reference frame? What is the fictitious force acting on M?", "solution": "Viewed from an inertial reference frame, M seems to be travelling in a circular path with constant speed. This is so because the non inertial frame, in which M is at rest, is rotating uniformly with respect to the inertial frame. Hence, to restate the first part of the problem, we are looking for the acceleration of a particle undergoing circular motion with constant speed. Now, acceleration is defined as a^\\ding{217} = (d^2r^\\ding{217})/(dt^2)(1) where r^\\ding{217} is the vector from the origin to the particle. We may write r^\\ding{217} in terms of its x and y components as r^\\ding{217} = x\u020a + y\\^{\\j}(2) where \u020a and \\^{\\j} are unit vectors (vectors of magnitude 1) in the positive x and y directions, respectively. We may also write x = r cos \\varphi y = r sin \\varphi(3) where r is the radius of the circle in which M travels. Substituting (3) in (2) we obtain: r^\\ding{217} = r (\u020a cos \\varphi+ \\^{\\j} sin \\varphi) Noting that r, \u020a, and \\^{\\j} are constant, and differentiating twice with respect to time, we obtains: (dr^\\ding{217}/dt) = r(- \u020a sin \\varphi + \\^{\\j} cos \\varphi)(d\\varphi/dt) (d^2r^\\ding{217}/dt^2) = r(- \u020a cos \\varphi + \\^{\\j} sin \\varphi)(d\\varphi/dt)^2 (d^2r^\\ding{217}/dt^2) = - r^\\ding{217} (d\\varphi/dt)^2(4) We now define (d\\varphi/dt) to be equal to \\omega, the angular velocity of the particle. (Physically, this is the number of radians the particle traces out per second.) Then, from (4) and (1) a^\\ding{217} = (d^2r^\\ding{217}/dt^2) = -\\omega^2 r^\\ding{217}(5) This acceleration, which always points in the -r^\\ding{217} direction (towards the center of the circular path), is called the centripetal acceleration. If we now choose to analyze the forces acting on M from the point of view of an observer sitting in the non-inertial frame, we must use a modified form of Newton's Second Law, because the usual form (F^\\ding{217} = ma^\\ding{217}) only holds in inertial reference frames. The new form of the Second Law is F^\\ding{217} - F'^\\ding{217} = Ma\"^\\ding{217}(6) where a\"^\\ding{217} is the acceleration of the system being examined as recorded in the non-inertial frame, F^\\ding{217} is the sum of all \"real\" forces acting on the system (i.e., tensions, gravity), - F'^\\ding{217} is the sum of all \"fictitious\" forces acting on the system (Carioles forces, centrifugal forces, etc.), and M is the mass of the system. In our example, since M is at rest in the non- inertial system, a\"^\\ding{217} = 0. Substitut-ing this in equation (6), we find: F^\\ding{217} = F'^\\ding{217}(7) Now, of course, we must obtain the same value for F^\\ding{217} no matter which frame we examine the mass M from, whether it be the rotating frame or the non-rotating frame, because F^\\ding{217}represents all real forces acting on M. Since we know nothing about - F'^\\ding{217}, let us find F^\\ding{217} in the inertial frame, and substitute this F^\\ding{217} into (7). In this way, we will be using our knowledge of dynamics in non-rotating frames to foster our knowledge of dynamics in rotating frames, and we will obtain - F'^\\ding{217}.

{"question": "High levels of progesterone are essential for the maintenance of the uterine lining during pregnancy. But high levels of progesterone exerts a negative feedback action on LH secretion, with a consequent decrease in LH secretion and eventual atrophy of the corpus luteum. Atrophy of the corpus luteum cuts the progesterone supply resulting in menstruation. Clearly, these events cannot take place after conception, or the embryo would get sloughed off. When conception occurs, the corpus luteum is seen to last through most of pregnancy. How can this be explained?", "solution": "It has been shown that the portion of the placenta called the chorion secretes a hormone, called chorionic gonadotrophin, that is functionally very similar to LH. The function of this hormone is to take the place of LH in preserving the corpus luteum, LH production being inhibited by a high progesterone level. The corpus luteum is then able to secrete progesterone at high levels without being shut off. The amount of this chorionic hormone produced in a pregnant woman is very great. A pregnant woman produces so much of this hormone that most of it is excreted in the urine. Many commonly used tests for pregnancy are based on this fact. One test involves the injection of the patient's urine into a test animal such as a rabbit. If chorionic hormone is in the urine, development of a corpus luteum within 24 hours will take place in the rabbit, and pregnancy can be confirmed. Although the corpus luteum is essential during early pregnancy and is present during most of pregnancy, it has been shown that it is no longer necessary after about the first two months. It seems that the placenta begins to secrete progesterone (and estrogen) early in pregnancy, and once this secretion has reached a sufficiently high level the placenta itself can maintain the pregnancy in the absence of the corpus luteum.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F21-0562.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The chorion of the placenta secretes a hormone, chorionic gonadotrophin, that is similar to LH and takes its place in preserving the corpus luteum, allowing it to secrete progesterone at high levels without being shut off."}
{"question": "Are there comparable changes, in the male, to female menopause?", "solution": "The changes that occur in the male due to aging are much less drastic than those which occur in the female. The testosterone and pituitary secretions which are initiated when the male reaches puberty continue throughout his adult life. Should the testosterone level decrease, this would result, through the switching-off of the negative-feedback inhibition on the pituitary, in a rise in the pituitary secretions of FSH and LH. Increased levels of FSH and LH stimulate testosterone production. Despite this, there is a steady decrease in testosterone secretion in later life, but this is probably caused by the slow deterioration of testicular function. Despite this decrease, testosterone secretion remains high enough in most men to maintain sexual vigor throughout life, and fertility has been documented in men in their seventies and eighties. Thus, there is usually no complete cessation of reproductive function in males analogous to female menopause.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F21-0565.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "No complete cessation of reproductive function in males analogous to female menopause."}
{"question": "A block of mass m slides down a plane inclined at an angle \\texttheta, the surface of which has coefficient of sliding friction \\mu. The mass collides with a spring, having force constant k, after it has slid a distance d from rest. The spring will then reduce the speed of the block, which, will come to a momentary halt, when the spring has been compressed a distance X. The block will then be pushed back up the incline and begin a frictionally damped harmonic oscillation. Calculate X.", "solution": "We will use the law of energy conservation. The kinetic energy of the block at the moment it collides with the spring is equal to the sum of its loss of gravitational potential energy and the work done on it by friction. Since the frictional force, f, acts in a direction opposite to the motion, the work due to friction is negative. Then (1/2) mv^2 = mgh - \\muNd where f = \\muN, and h = d sin \\texttheta is the vertical height through which the block falls, (see figure). N = mg cos \\texttheta is the force the plane exerts, normal to its surface, on the block to cancel the component of the block's weight perpendicular to the plane. Thus: (1/2) mv^2 = mg d sin \\texttheta - \\mu mg d cos \\texttheta = mg d(sin \\texttheta - \\mu cos \\texttheta) Once the spring has brought the block to rest, the spring's potential energy is equal to the sum of the block's kinetic energy, the further gravitational po-tential energy the block loses as it falls through height h' = X sin \\texttheta, and the additional (negative) work done by friction on the block (see figure).

{"question": "It has been determined experimentally that two elements, A and B react chemically to produce a compound or compounds.

(b) If 80 g of element: B combines with 355 g of a third element C, what weight of A will combine with 71 g of element C? (c) If element B is oxygen, what is the equivalent weight of element C?", "solution": "(a) If one adds the weight of A to the weight of B and obtains the weight of the compound formed, the Law of Conservation of Mass is illustrated. This law states that there is no detectable gain or loss of mass in a chemical change. Using the data from the experiments described, you find the following: For experiment 16.08 g A + 4.00 g B = 10.08 g of compound 6.08 + 4.00 = 10.08 For experiment 218.24 g A + 12.00 g B =30.24 g of compound 18.24 + 12.00 = 30.24 For experiment 303.04 g A +2.00 g B =5.04 g of compound 3.24 +2.00 = 5.04 From these calculations one can see that the Law of Conservation of Mass is shown. Another important law of chemistry is the Law of Definite Proportions. This law is stated: When elements combine to form a given compound, they do so in a fixed and invariable ratio by weight. One can check to see if this law is adhered to by calculating the ratio of the weight of A to the weight of B in the three experiments. If all of these ratios are equal, the Law of Definite Proportions is shown. For experiment 16.08 g A /4.00 g B = 1.5 For experiment 218.24 g A / 12.00 g B =1.5 For experiment 303.04 g A /2.00 g B =1.5 The Law of Definite Proportions is illustrated here. (1) From the Law of Definite Proportions, one can find the number of grams of B that will combine with 71 g of C. After this weight is found, one can find the number of grams of A that will react with 71 g of C by finding the amount of A that reacts with that amount of B. It is assumed that the amount of A that reacts with 71 g of C is equal to the amount of A that will react with the amount of B that reacts with 71 g of C. The amount of A that will react with this amount of B can be found by remembering from the previous section of this problem, that A reacts with B in a ratio of 1.5. (1) Finding the amount B that would react with 71 g of C. One is told that 80 g of B reacts with 355 g of C. By the Law of Definite Proportions, a ratio can be set up to calculate the number of grams of B that will react with 71 g of C. Let x = the number of grams of B that will react with 71 g of C. (80g B) / (355 g C) = (x g B) / (71 g C) (80g B) / (355 g C) = (x g B) / (71 g C) x= (71 \u00d7 80) / (355) = 16. x= (71 \u00d7 80) / (355) = 16. 16 grams of B will react with 71 g of C. (2) It is assumed that the same amount of A that will react with 16 g of B will react with 71 g of C. Therefore, using the fact that the ratio of the amount of A that reacts to the amount of B is equal to 1.5 (this fact was obtained in part (1)), one can calculate the amount of A that will react with 71 g of C. Let x = the number of grams of A that will react with 16 g of B . (xg A) / (16g B) = 1.5 x = 16 \u00d7 1.5 = 24 g. 24 g of A will react with 16 g of B or 71 g of C. (c) In finding the equivalent weight of C when B is taken to be oxygen, the Law of Definite Proportions is used again. The equivalent weight of oxygen is 8. Knowing that 16 g of B react with 71 g of C, one can set up the following ratio x = weight of C if the weight of B is taken to be 8. (71 g C) / (16 g B) = (xg C) / (8g B) x = (8 \u00d7 71) / (16) = 35.5 g. The equivalent weight of C when B is taken to be oxygen is 35.5 g.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E04-0130.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The laws illustrated are the Law of Conservation of Mass and the Law of Definite Proportions.

{"question": "Soon after the Mendelian laws became firmly established, numerous exceptions to Mendel's second law, the Law of Independent Segregation, were demonstrated by experiments. Parental non-allelic gene combinations were found to occur with much greater frequencies in offspring than were the non-parental combinations. How can this be explained?", "solution": "The Law of Independent Segregation states that when two or more pairs of genes are involved in a cross, the members of one pair segregate independently of the members of all other pairs. This law was substantiated by Mendel's experiments with sea plants. However, in Mendel's time, the physical nature of genes was not known, nor was it known how they are carried. When it was learned that chromosomes are the bearers of genes, the reasons why Mendel's law was both supported by some experiments and negated by others became obvious. It was seen that the chromosomes are relatively few in number. For example, Orosophila have only four pairs of chromosomes. Man has twenty-three pairs. In compa-rison, however, the number of genes possessed by each species is very large, often in the thousands. Since there are so many more genes than chromosomes, and the chromosomes carry the genes, it follows that there must be many genes on each chromosome. And since it is now known that it is whole chromosomes which segregate independently during meiosis, gene separation can only be independent if the genes in question are on different chromosomes. Genes located on the same chromosomes are physically forced to move together during meiosis. Such genes are said to show linkage. When genetic experiments are performed using genes that are linked, very different ratios from the expected Mendelian ratios are obtained. Genes that were linked together on parental chromosomes tend to remain together in the gametes, and so occur in conjuction with one another more frequently in the offspring than they would if they had segregated independently. Exactly how linkage produces these variant ratios will be dealt with in later problems. At the present we can see that linkage explains how exceptions to the Law of Independent Segregation could possibly occur.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F25-0671.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Linkage explains how exceptions to the Law of Independent Segregation could possibly occur."}

To balance this type of re-action , you want to conserve charge and matter, i.e., one side of the equation must not have an excess of charge or matter. To perform this balancing, you need to (1)Balance charge by adding H^+ (in acid) or OH^- (in base) . (2) Balance oxygen by adding water. (3) Balance atoms (of hydrogen) by adding hydrogen to appropriate side. These three rules will balance the redox equation. These rules apply to balancing only the half-reactions. The overall reaction; the sum of these, will be balanced by their addition. Proceed as follows: Fe^2+ goes to Fe^3+. It lost an electron thus, it's the oxidation half reaction. To balance charge, add H^+. Thus, Fe^2+ + H^+ \\rightarrow Fe^3+. To conserve mass, add an H atom to right. You obtain Fe^2+ + H^+ \\rightarrow Fe^3+ + (1 / 2)H_2.

{"question": "Describe the characteristic differences between the monotreme, marsupial and placental mammals.", "solution": "The class Mammalia is divided into three sub-classes: Prototheria (Monotremes), Metatheria (Marsupials), and Eutheria (placental mammals). Of these three, the mono-tremes can be considered the most primitive. They are an early offshoot of the main mammalian groups. The Marsupials and Placentials appeared at about the same time. Major characteristics of mammals include the possession of mammary glands and hair. Most mammals have sweat glands. All mammals are homeotherms. Monotremes are peculiar in that they possess mammalian as well as reptilian traits. They are classified as mammals, however, because the number of mammalian traits far exceed the number of reptilian traits. Some of the more outstanding mammalian traits include: a layer of hair covering the body and the secretion of milk by mammary glands. There are only two surviving species of monotremes: the duck-billed platypus and the spiny anteater, both of which are found in Australia. The trait that most clearly distinguishes monotremes from other groups of mammals is their ability to lay eggs. In marsupials and placentals, embryonic development occurs in the uterus of the female. The characteristic difference between the marsupials and the placentals is the time of embryonic development within the uterus. Marsupial embryos undergo a short developmental period before they leave the uterus. Embryonic development is completed in an abdominal pouch of the mother where the embryo is attached to a nipple. In contrast to this is the placentals. In this group, the embryo develops completely in the uterus of the mother. In both marsupial and placental mammals, the young are born alive.", "images": ["images/F13-0343_files/image002.jpg", "images/F13-0343_files/image004.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F13-0343.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Monotremes possess mammalian and reptilian traits and lay eggs.

One way to precipitate out the barium ion (Ba^2+) is by adding a dilute solution of Na_2SO_4. The reason is that Na_2SO_4, reacts with Ba2+and NO^-_3 ions to produce BaSO_4, and NaNO_3. The barium sulfate is extremely insoluble as indicated by a solubility product constant of 1.6 \u00d7 10^-9 mole^2 liter^-2.

Let dx = \u2206x = 0.05, and output a table containing the following quantities: x, y, y2, x2, y2 - x2, dy .", "solution": "Let us first develop the problem from a mathematical view-point. Before we begin solving the equation we must know that a solu-tion exists. Furthermore, this solution should be unique. The exist-ence and uniqueness conditions for the solution of a given differential equation are contained in the following theorems: 1) Existence: Let y' = \\varphi(x, y). 0 \\leq x \\leq 1, - \\infty < y < \\infty, y(0) = c If \\varphi is continuous and bounded, then y = y(x) is a solution of (dy/dx) = \\varphi(x, y). 2) Uniqueness: If there exists a constant A (Lipschitz number) such that \\vert\\varphi(x,y2) - \\varphi(x, y1)\\vert \\leq A \\verty2 - y1\\vert (where (x, y1), (x,y2) are in the domain), then y = y(x) is a unique solution to y' = \\varphi(x, y). The given differential equation is \\varphi(x,y) = (dy/dx) = y2 - x20 \\leq x \\leq 0.5, y(0) = 1 \\varphi(x,y) is a difference of continuous functions; hence it is contin-uous. Clearly\\vert y2 - x2 \\vert is bounded (i.e., less than some constant K) in [0,0.5]. Thus a solution exists. Let A = .3. Then\\vert\\varphi(x, y2) - \\varphi(x, y1)\\vert\\leq .3(y2 - y1) for all (x, y1), (x, y2) in the domain. Thus the solution is unique. We can rewrite equation (1) in the differential form dy = (y2 - x2)dx(2) The increment method entails the use of differentials to find approxi-mate values of y. Thus, let \u2206x = dx, \u2206y = dy. Since the initial condition is y(0) = 1, we can substitute into equation (2) and obtain \u2206y = (12 - 02)(0.05) \u2206y = 0.05 thus, at x = 0.05, y = y0 + \u2206y becomes 1 + 0.05 = 1.05. This means that now y(1.00) becomes 1.05. The next value of \u2206y becomes, there-fore \u2206y = ((1.05)2 - (0.05)2)(0.05) \u2206y = 0.055 As you can see, the method readily lends itself to computer implemen-tation.

{"question": "Define a buffering system. What significance does it have in the living cell?", "solution": "A buffering system is one that will prevent significant changes in pH, upon addition of excess hydrogen or hydroxide ion to the system. Buffering systems are of great importance in the maintenance of the cell. For example, the enzymes within a cell have an optimal pH range, and outside this range, enzymatic activity will be sharply reduced. If the pH becomes too extreme, the enzymes and proteins within the cell may be denatured, which would cause cellular activity to drop to zero and the cell would die. Hence a buffering system is essential to the existence of the cell. The average pH of a cell is 7.2, which is slightly on the basic side. A buffer will prevent significant pH changes upon variation of the hydrogen ion concentration by abstracting or releasing a proton. Relatively weak diprotic acids (Ex: H_2CO_3, carbonic acid) are good buffers in living systems. When carbonic acid undergoes its first dissociation reaction, it forms a proton and a bicarbonate ion: H_2CO_3 \\rightleftarrows H^+ + HCO_3^-. The pH of the system is due to the concentration of H^+ formed by the dissociation of H_2CO_3. Upon addition of H^+, the bicarbonate ion will become protonated so that the total H^+ concentration of the medium remains about the same. Similarly, upon addition of ^-OH, the bicarbonate ion releases a hydrogen to form water with the ^-OH. This maintains the H^+ concentration and hence keeps the pH constant. These reactions are illustrated below:", "images": ["images/F01-0027_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F01-0027.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "A buffering system is one that will prevent significant changes in pH, upon addition of excess hydrogen or hydroxide ion to the system.

{"question": "Mendel believed that hereditary factors were always either dominant or recessive. How might he have altered this view had he performed the following cross? When pure line sweet peas with red flowers are crossed with pure line plants having white flowers, all the F_1 plants have pink flowers.", "solution": "Let R be the gene for red color and W be the gene for white color. In the cross: After observing such a cross, Mendel could not have proposed the concepts of dominance or recessiveness, because there is evidence for neither in the results. It is possible that he might have proposed the idea of \"blending\"; saying that the heterozygous genotype is the result of a genotypic blending of the two alleles. This would be erroneous however, because the two alleles still act and separate independently. This could be evidenced if a cross between two F_1 plants were done: Two pink flowered plants have produced not only pink offspring, but also offspring having the red and white homozygous traits. Therefore the genes are still sepa-rating independently in the heterozygotes. Mendel could have proposed that the two genes products interracted to form some sort of phenotypically blended product, but this is not exactly what occurs. If one looked closely at the pink flowers of the hetero-zygote, the independent action of each of the alleles is obvious. The pink color is not the result of some sort of blending to produce pink pigment, but results from the independent expressions of the red and the white pigments in the flower. The flower appears pink because of the interspersion of the red and white pigment granules in the petal. The two alleles are said to be codominant. In such a case, neither allele is expressed in preference to the other.

{"question": "Discuss the early development of the angiosperm embryo. What primary structure form and what does become in the seeding?", "solution": "The first cell division that the zygote undergoes following fertilization produces a basal cell and a terminal cell. The basal cell develops into the suspensor, a filament of cells serving as a point of attachment for the embryo within the seed. The suspensor will eventually disintegrate as development of the embryo proceeds. The embryo will develop from the terminal cell, and as the cell undergoes successive divisions, the characteristic structures of the embryo begin to take shape (see figure 1). The most obvious of these are the cotyledons, or primary leaves. Dicots develop two such leaves, monocots only one. In dicots, the cotyledons can serve to either absorb or to both store and absorb food from the endosperm while within the seed. In the monocots, the single cotyledon serves primarily to absorb, rather than store, the endosperm tissue. The portion of the embryo lying along the central axis below the point of attachment of the cotyledons is called the hypocotyl and the part above is called the epicotyl. At this point in its development, the embryo becomes dormant, and will remain so until conditions are favorable for its germi-nation. Upon germination, the hypocotyl elongates and emerges from the seed coat (see Fig. 2). It gives rise to the primitive root or radicle. Since the radicle is strongly and positively geotropic, it grows directly downward into the soil. The arching of the hypocotyl in the seed pulls the cotyledons and epicotyl out of the seed coat. The epicotyl, being negatively geotropic, grows upward out of the soil. It will develop into the stem and leaves. In most dicots, by the time germination occurs, the cotyledons will have completely absorbed the endosperm. They now serve as reserves of food for the growing seedling until it has developed enough chlorophyll to become independent, at which point they shrivel and fall off.

{"question": "During low tide, tough, shapeless organisms can be seen attached to rocks near the low tide line. These organisms can be seen to eject water from their bodies when they contract. What are these organisms?", "solution": "These sessile marine organisms are known as the tunicates, or sea squirts, which belong to the subphylum Urochordata. There is nothing in the external appearance of the adult that suggests it is a member of the chordates. The adult body is covered by a tough, leathery tunic, composed principally of a kind of cellulose. Within the tunic, the greater portion of the body is comprised of a pharynx perforated by numerous gill slits. The tunic has two openings: the incurrent and excurrent siphens. Water and nutrients enter the body via the incurrent siphon. After entering the pharynx and having the food particles digested, the waste products are carried by the water to the excurrent siphon where they are released from the body. During reproduction, the gametes leave the animal via the excurrent siphon. Tunicates are filter- feeders, removing food particles from the stream of water passing through the pharynx. The food particles are trapped in mucus secreted by part of the pharynx called the endostyle, and are carried down by ciliated cells into the esophogus and digestive gland. The flow of water through the tunicate is maintained by the contraction of the body wall. Whereas the adult tunicate is a sessile organism, the tunicate larva is motile, and shows a greater re-semblance to the other chordates. They possess a well- developed dorsal hollow nerve cord, a notochord beneath it in the tail region, and pharyngeal gill slits. When the larvae settle down and undergo metamorphosis into the adult form, the notochord is completely lost.

{"question": "When carbon dioxide combines with water, carbonic acid is produced and rapidly dissociates to the bicarbonate ion and free hydrogen ions: CO_2 + H_2O\\rightarrowH_2CO3 H_2CO_3\\rightarrowH^+ + HCO_3^\\rule{1em}{1pt} When carbon dioxide is carried by the blood, why doesn't the blood become acidic owing to the presence of free H^+?", "solution": "Not only does the blood transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues (via hemoglobin), it also transports carbon dioxide in the reverse direction, from the tissues to the lungs. Some of the carbon dioxide (\\sim 7%) is carried as gas dissolved in the plasma. A slightly larger proportion (\\sim 23%) is carried by hemoglobin; the carbon dioxide-hemoglobin complex is called carbaminohemoglobin. The loosely bound CO_2 is combined with the terminal amino groups of all four polypeptide chains; each hemoglobin molecule having four polypeptide chains, can bind four CO_2 molecules. Since CO_2 does not combine with hemoglobin at the same site as oxygen, hemoglobin can transport both oxygen and carbon dioxide at the same time. However, most of the CO_2 (70%) is transported as the bicarbonate ion, HCO_3^-. Carbon dioxide enters red blood cells where it reacts with water to form carbonic acid: This reaction can only occur because of an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase. The carbonic acid quickly dissociates into hydrogen and bicarbonate ions: H_2CO_3\\rightarrowH^+ + HCO_3^- The presence of free H^+ ions should drop the pH of the blood significantly. Since cells can only live within a narrow range of pHs, this change would be physiologically harmful. But the blood exhibits only very slight variations (\\pm.04 pH units) around the normal pH of 7.4. What accounts for this phenomenon? The pH would not drop if the H^+ ions could be combined with some substance, so as to remove them as free ions from solution. The H^+ ions combine with an ionized form of hemoglobin (Hb^-) to form acid hemoglobin (HHb) while the HCO_3^- leaves the red blood cell and enters the plasma. HCO_3^- + H^+ + Hb^-\\rightarrowHCO_3^- + HHb Acid hemoglobin dissociates to a much lesser degree than does carbonic acid, so that most H^+ ions remain bound, and therefore effectively removed from solution. Acid hemoglobin acts as a buffer in the blood. A buffer is a substance which prevents large changes in pH. When there is an excess of H^+ ions(when the pH drops), hemoglobin binds H^+ ions to remove them from solution, thus restoring the pH. Hb^-+H^+\\rightarrowHHb When the blood becomes alkaline because of an excess of hydroxide ions (OH^-) or a decrease of H^+, the acid hemo-globin dissociates, releasing H^+ and restoring the pH: OH^- + HHb \\rightarrow OH^- + H^+ +Hb^- \\rightarrow H_2O + Hb^- Hemoglobin and some plasma proteins act to prevent the large deviations from the normal pH which would occur in carbon dioxide transport. A summary of CO_2 transport is provided in the following illustration: The reverse process occurs in the lungs. Carbaminohemoglobin dissociates to release CO_2. Acid hemoglobin dissociates to produce H^+ ions which combine with bicar-bonate ions to form carbonic acid. This acid, then dissoci-ates to form water and CO_2, which is expired from the lungs.", "images": ["images/F14-0354_files/image002.jpg", "images/F14-0354_files/image004.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F14-0354.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Hemoglobin and some plasma proteins act to prevent the large deviations from the normal pH which would occur in carbon dioxide transport."}

If the molecular weight of this compound is 360 g/mole, what is its molecular formula?", "solution": "Molecular formula may be defined as the formula stating the actual number of each type atom in a particular compound. Problems of this sort are solved by assuming a sample of some convenient mass and then calculating the number of moles of each atom in this sample. Once the number of moles has been calculated for each component, these numbers are divided by the greatest common factor in order to obtain the proportions in which the various components appear in the molecule (empirical formula). From this, we check to see if the elements, in those proportions, give the actual molecular weight. If they do, we have the actual molecular formula. If they do not, we multiply by a factor until their weights do give the molecular weight. There is no error in assuming a sample of definite mass, since the size of a sampleof molecules does not affect the composition of the molecules. Assume a sample weighing 100 g. Then the masses of C, H, and O in the sample are: mass C = 69.96 % \u00d7 100 g = 69.96 g mass H = 7.83 %\u00d7 100 g =7.83 g mass O = 22.21 % \u00d7 100 g = 22.21 g We convert the mass of each element to the correspond-ing number of moles by dividing by the atomic weight of that element. Thus, we obtain the following number of moles of each element: moles C = (69.96 g) / (12.0 g/mole) = 5.83 moles moles H = (7.83 g)/ (1.01 g/mole)= 7.75 moles moles O = (22.21 g)/ (16.0 g/mole) = 1.39 moles The greatest common factor is 1.39 moles. Dividing the number of moles of each element by 1.39 moles, we obtain (moles C) / (1.39moles) = (5.83moles) / (1.39moles) \\allequal 4.2. (moles H) / (1.39moles) = (7.75moles) / (1.39moles) \\allequal 5.6. (moles O) / (1.39moles) = (1.39moles) / (1.39moles) \\allequal 1.

It is then compressed to its original volume at constant pressure and further compressed isothermally to its original pressure. Plot the process on a p-V diagram and calculate the total work done on the gas. If 50 J of heat were removed during the constant-pressure process, what would be the total change in internal energy?", "solution": "During an isothermal change, T is constant. The work done on the gas in such a change is W = -^Vf\\intVip dV. This is negative because the pressure on v_i the gas is in opposition to the volume change.

Further, since the volume is doubled, by the application of Boyle's law p_1V_1 =p_2V_2 we see that the pressure is halved at (2) p_2 = p_1 (V_1/V_2) = (1/2)p_1. The work done on the gas in the second change is [from (2) to (3)] W_2 = -p_2 ^V3\\int_V2 dV = -p_2(V_3 - V_2) = (1/2)p_1(V_1 - 2V_1) = (1/2)p_1V_1 = (1.013 \u00d7 10^6 dynes/cm^2 \u00d7 10^3 cm^3) / (2 x 10^7ergs/J) = 50.65 J. The work done on the gas in the final change from (3) to (4) is W_3 = -p_3V_3 1n (p_3/p_4) = -(1/2)p_1v_1 1n(P_2/P_1) = (1/2)p_1V_1 1n (1/2) = (1/2) p_1V_1 1n 2 = [1.013 \u00d7 10^6 dynes/cm^2 \u00d7 10^3 cm^3 \u00d7 in(2)] / [2 x 10^7ergs/J] = 35.11 J The total work done on the gas is thus W1+ W_2 + W_3 = (50.65 + 35.11 - 70.22)J = 15.54 J. In the first and third processes the temperature does not change. In an ideal gas the internal energy depends only on the temperature, so that no change of internal energy takes place in the first and third processes. Any work done on the gas in these changes is equal to the heat transfer taking place. The second process is isobaric. The change in internal energy during the process is given by the first law of thermodynamics as \u2206U = Q - W, where Q is the heat energy added to the system and W the work done by the system. Hence \u2206U = -50 J - (-50.65 J) = +0.65 J.

These are winged insects, or if wingless, the loss of wings is secondary. Some of the better known orders will be further discussed. OrderThysanuracontains primitive wingless insects with chewing mouthparts and long tail-like appendages. Silverfish and bristletails are members of this order. Some species are commonly found in houses and eat books and clothing. OrderOdonatacontains dragonflies and damsel flies. The two pairs of long membranous wings are held permanent-ly at right angles to the body. They have chewing mouth-parts and large compound eyes. Immature forms of these insects (nymphs) are aquatic (fresh water). Other winged insects can fold their wings back over the body when they are not flying. OrderOrthopteracontains grasshoppers, crickets and cockroaches. The forewings are usually leather-like. They do not function in flying, but function as covers for the folded hind-wings. The chewing mouthparts are strong. Termites are social insects that belong to the orderIsoptera. Both winged and wingless varieties comprise the termite colony. OrderHemipteracontains the true bugs.

{"question": "Describe the pathway of electron transport in the respiratory chain.", "solution": "A chain of electron carriers is responsible for transferring electrons through a sequence of steps from molecules such as NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) to molecular oxygen. NADH collects electrons from many different substrates through the action of NAD+ - linked dehydrogenases. For example, NADH is produced from the oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate in glycolysis, and by several dehydrogenations in the citric acid cycle. In the electron transport system, NADH is oxidized to NAD+ with the corresponding reduction of flavin mono-nucleotide (FMN) to FMNH_2. (see Figure 1). Some of the energy released is used for the production of one ATP molecule. Then FMNH_2 is oxidized back to FMN, and the electrons of FMNH_2 are transferred to ubiquinone or coenzyme Q. It is at this site where the electrons of FADH_2 are funneled into the electron transport chain. As ubiquinone is oxidized, the first of a series of cytochromes, cytochrome b, is reduced. The cytochromes are large heme proteins (see Fig. 2). A heme group consists an iron atom surrounded by a flat organic molecule called a porphyrin ring. It is the iron atom of the cytochrome which is oxidized (Fe^3+) or reduced (Fe^2+) . Cytochrome b reduces cytochrome c_1; the energy released is used for the formation of a sec-ond ATP molecule. Cytochrome c_1 reduced to cytochrome c (not shown in figure) which in turn reduces cytochrome a (a complex of cytochromes a and a_3, plus two copper atoms), cytochrome a is oxidized in the last step, with molecular oxygen being the final electron acceptor. As oxygen is reduced to H_2O, a third and last ATP molecule is synthesized. Thus for each NADH molecule entering the respiratory chain, 3 ATP molecules are produced. Therefore, eight NADH molecules give rise to 24 ATP per glucose molecule in the citric acid cycle. Only 4 ATP are produced by the 2 FADH_2 molecules, since they enter the electron transport system at ubiquinone, thus bypassing the first site of ATP synthesis. The two cytoplasmic NADH from glycolysis produce only four ATP instead of six because one ATP is expended per cytoplasmic NADH in order to actively transport NADH across the mitochondrial membrane. By means of the respiratory chain, 32 ATP are produced per glucose mole- cule. The other 4 ATP molecules are produced during substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Thus there is a net yield of 36 ATP per glucose molecule oxidized.

{"question": "In sickle-cell anemia, what causes the erythrocytes to assume a sickle shape? Why is the incidence of sickle -cell anemia high in Africa, where the incidence of malaria is also high?", "solution": "Sickle-cell anemia is caused by an abnormal type of hemoglobin, termed hemoglobin S. Hemoglobin S differs from normal adult hemoglobin in that it contains a different amino acid in one of its polypeptide chains (valineinstead of glutamate in one of the \\beta chains). This alteration greatly reduces the solubility of de-oxygenated hemoglobin S. The amino acid substitution creates a site on the surface of the hemoglobin molecule, sometimes referred to as a \"sticky patch.\" Onlyde-oxyhemoglobinS has a complementary site to this sticky patch. Therefore, thedeoxyhemoglobin molecules bind to each other, forming long aggregates which precipitate and distort the normal shape of the erythrocyte. Besides elongating the cell to the familiar sickle or crescent shape, the precipitated hemoglobin also damages the cell membrane, making the cell fragile. Thesickledcells either become trapped in small blood vessels (because of their distorted shape), causing impaired circulation and tissue damage, or they readily lyse because of their fragility. Sometimes, a vicious cycle is initiated when sickled cells cause vascular blockage. The blockage of the vessels creates a region of tissues where the oxygen con-centration is low. This deficiency causes moreoxyhemo-globinS to change into thedeoxyform, which in turn causes moresicklingand further decreases the oxygen concentration. This cycle progresses quickly and the resul-ting anemia is usually severe, often resulting in shock and death. Sickle-cell anemia is genetically transmitted. Sickle-cell anemic are homozygous for an abnormal gene which codes for synthesis of the abnormal hemoglobin S. Heterozygous individuals, who have one normal and one substitute allele, carry the sickle-cell trait. They do not usually show the symptoms of the disease except under conditions of low oxygen such as occurs in high altitude. The incidence of malaria and the frequency of the sickle-cell gene in Africa are correlated. It has been discovered that individuals carrying the sickle-cell trait (heterozygotes) are protected against a lethal form of malaria. This protection acts as a strong selective pressure to maintain the high incidence of the sickle-cell gene in regions where the incidence of malaria is high. This is an example of balanced polymorphism: the hetero zygote is protected against malaria and does not show the symptoms of sickle-cell disease , whereas the sickle-cell homozygote is eliminated by anemia and the normal homozygote is eliminated by malaria.

Two gametes fuse to form a diploid cell, which may give rise to a new multi-cellular individual via mitotic division, or which may itself undergo meiosis to form new haploid cells. The diploid cell that results when two gametes fuse is termed a zygote. The zygote is always diploid and is always a single cell. Life cycles of algae and fungi show much more variability than life cycles of higher plants and animals. The different species within a phylum often have very different life cycles, and most algae and fungi are capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction occurs when two haploid gametes fuse to form a zygote. Asexual reproduction occurs by frag-mentation, with each fragment growing into a new plant or thallus. Asexual reproduction also involves mitotic division of a single cell of a thallus to produce daughter cells which are released from the parent thallus to grow into new algae or fungi. Daughter cells which are motile and specialized for asexual reproduction are termed zoospores. In certain species, alternation of generations occurs. This type of life cycle includes both a multi-cellular haploid plant and a multicellular diploid plant, and both sexual and asexual reproduction. In algae, fungi, and most other lower plant forms, the dominant generation is the haploid one, and the reverse is true in the higher plants. Ulva (sea lettuce) , a green alga, and Ectocarpus (a brown alga) are representative of organisms which show alternation of generations. The entire life cycle can be summarized as follows: Haploid zoospores (stage 1) divide mitotically to produce a haploid multicellular thallus (stage 2). These haploid thalli may reproduce asexually by means of zoospores or sexually by means of gametes (stage 3). Gametes fuse to produce a diploid zygote (stage 4). The zygote divides mitotically to produce a diploid multi-cellular thallus (stage 5). Certain reproductive cells of the diploid thallus divide by meiosis to produce zoospores (stage 1). The zoospores are released, and begin the cycle anew. The haploid multicellular stage is called a gametophyte because it is a plant that produces gametes. The diploid multicellular stage is called a sporophyte because it is a plant that produces spores.", "images": ["images/F06-0172_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F06-0172.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "A haploid organism possesses a single complete set of chromosomes while a diploid organism has two sets of chromosomes.

{"question": "An airplane is traveling horizontally at 480 mph at a height of 6400 ft. The airplane drops a bomb aimed at a stationary target on the ground. To an observer on the aircraft, what angle must the target make with the vertical, when the bomb is dropped, if the bomb is to hit the target? (See the figure.) Suppose that the target is a ship which is steaming at 20 mph away from the aircraft along its line of flight. What alterations would need to be made to the previous calculations?", "solution": "At the moment of release of the bomb, time t = 0, the airplane is at the point which is taken as the origin of the coordinate system, traveling in the positive x-direction with a speed u of 480 mph. 480 mph = 480 (mile/hr) \u00d7 ( 5280 ft/mile) \u00d7 (1hr/60 min) \u00d7 (1min/ 60 sec) = 704 ft/sec. The bomb has the same initial speed. There is no acceleration in the x-direction, for no horizontal force acts on the system. Hence, after time t, when the bomb strikes the target, the distance traveled by the bomb in this direction is given by the kinematic equation for constant velocity, x_0 = ut. The airplane and bomb have no initial speed in the y-direction, but the acceleration g acts in this direction. After time t, the downward distance travel-ed by the released bomb will be, using the kinematic equation for constant acceleration Since ^vo_y = o, this becomes y_0 = 1/2gt^2 \\bullet y_o = ^vo_y t + 1/2 gt^2. But y_0 = 6400 ft in this problem, and the time it takes the object to fall this distance is therefore t = \\surd[(2y_0)/(g)] = \\surd[(2 \u00d7 6400 ft)/(32 ft\\bullets^-2)] = 20 s. Thus, in the same time, the object moves a horizontal distance x_0 = ut = 704 ft\\bullets^-1 \u00d7 20 s = 14,080 ft andtan \\texttheta = x_0/y_0 = (14080 ft)/(6400 ft) = 2.2 or \\texttheta = 65.5\\textdegree. The bomb should be released when the target is seen at an angle of 65.5\\textdegree to the vertical. If the target is moving, the relative velocity, between plane and ship is the important velocity. For, relative to the ship, the bomb has an initial velocity v_BS\\ding{217} = v_BW\\ding{217} + v_WS\\ding{217}, where v_BW\\ding{217} is the initial velocity of the bomb relative to the water, and v_WS\\ding{217} the velocity of the water relative to the ship. Since the velocity of the ship relative to water (v_SW\\ding{217}) is given as 20 mph, the v_WS\\ding{217} = - 20 mph. Thus v_BS = (480 - 20)mph = 460 mph = 450 (mile/hr) \u00d7 (5280 ft/mile) \u00d7 (1 hr/60min) \u00d7 (1 min/60 sec) = 674.6 ft/sec The foregoing analysis can thus be carried out once more, with v_BS in place of u.

{"question": "What are the distinguishing characteristics of cardiac and smoothmuscle.", "solution": "Smooth muscle fibers are considerably smaller than skeletal musclefibers. Each smooth muscle fiber has a single nucleus located in thecentral portion of the cell. By contrast, each skeletal muscle fiber is multi-nucleatedwith the nuclei located peripherally. The most noticeable morphologicalfactordistingushingsmooth from either skeletal or cardiac muscleis the absence of striated banding patterns in the cytoplasm of smoothmuscle. Smooth muscle does not contain myofibrils. However, myosinthick filaments andactinthin filaments can be seen distributed throughoutthe cytoplasm, oriented parallel to the muscle fiber, but not organizedinto regular units of filaments as in skeletal and cardiac muscle. It is believed that the molecular events of force generation in Smooth muscle cells are similar to those in skeletal muscle. Smooth muscleexhibits wide varia-tions in tonus; it may remain almost entirely relaxedor tightly contracted. Also, it apparently can maintain the contractedcondition of tonus without the expenditure of energy, perhaps owingto a reorganization of the protein chains making up the fibers. Smooth muscle cells are not under voluntary control. Their activity is underthe regulation of the autonomic nervous system and they have an abilityto perform work for long periods of time, since their contraction is slowand sustained. Smooth muscle is often referred to as a visceral musclesince it regulates the internal environment of a great many systemsand organs. It is found in the walls of hollow organs such as the intestinaltract, the bronchioles, the urinary blad-der, and the uterus. Vascular smooth muscle lines the walls of blood vessels. It may also be foundas single cells dis-tributed throughout an organ such as the spleen or insmall groups of cells attached to the hairs in the skin. Cardiac muscle has properties similar to those of skeletal muscle. It is multinucleated and striated, with its thick and thinmyofilaments organizedinto myofibrils. The sliding-filament type of contraction is also foundin cardiac muscle. Unlike skeletal muscle but like smooth muscle, cardiacmuscle is involuntary. Each beat of the heart represents a single twitch. Cardiac muscle has a long refractory period. Consequently, it is unableto contracttetanically, since one twitch cannot follow another quicklyenough to maintain a contracted state. A unique feature of cardiac muscleis its inherentrhyth-micity; it contracts at a rate of about 72 beats perminute. The muscle is innervated by nerves, but these nerves only serveto speed up or slow down the inherent cardiac rhythm. In addition, cardiacmuscle is unique in having intercalated discs, or tight junctions, betweencells; these aid in the transmission of electrical impulses throughout the heart.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F19-0464.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Smooth muscle fibers are smaller, single-nucleated, and lack striated banding patterns.

{"question": "What are some of the important properties and characteris-ticsofenyzmes?", "solution": "An important property of enzymes is their catalytic ability. Enzymes controlthe speed of many chemical reactions that occur in the cell. To understandthe efficiency of an enzyme, one can measure the rate at whichan enzyme operates - also called the turnover number. The turnovernumber is the number of molecules of substrate which is acted uponby a molecule of enzyme per second. Most enzymes have high turnovernumbers and are thus needed in the cell in relatively small amounts. The maximum turnover number ofcatalase, an enzyme which decomposeshydrogen peroxide, is 10^7 molecules/sec. It would require yearsfor an iron atom to accomplish the same task. A second important property of enzymes is their specificity, that is, thenumber of different substrates they are able to act upon. The surface ofthe enzyme reflects this specificity. Each enzyme has a region called a bindingsite to which only certain substrate molecules can bind efficiently. There are varying degrees of spe-cificity:urease, which decomposes urea toammonia and carbon dioxide, will react with no other substance; howeverlipase will hydrolyze the ester bonds of a wide variety of fats. Another aspect of enzymatic activity is the coupling of a spontaneousreaction with a non-spontaneous reaction.An energy- requiringreaction proceeds with an increase in free energy and is non- spontaneous. To drive this reaction, a spontaneous energy-yielding reactionoccurs at the same time. The enzyme acts by harnessing the energyof the energy-yielding reaction and transferring it to the energy- requiringreaction. Thestructure of different enzymes differsigni-ficantly. Some are composedsolely of protein (for example, pepsin). Others consist of two parts: a protein part (also called anapoenzyme) and a non-protein part, eitheran or-ganic coenzyme or an inorganic cofactor, such as a metal ion. Only when both parts are combined can activity occur. There are other important considerations. Enzymes, as catalysts, donot determine the direction a reaction will go, but only the rate at which thereaction reaches equilib-rium. Enzymes are efficient because they are neeededin very little amounts and can be used repeatedly. As enzymes areproteins, they can be permanently inactivated or de-natured by extremesin temperature and pH, and also have an optimal temperature or pHrange within which they work most efficiently.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F03-0066.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Enzymes have catalytic ability, specificity, and can couple spontaneous and non-spontaneous reactions.

(b) If the cell contains 15,000 ribosomes, what percent of the volume do they occupy? You may assume them to be spherical with a diameter of 180 \\AA; also 10^4 \\AA = 1 micron.", "solution": "(a) Because you are told the molecular weight of an average lipid molecule, you need only compute their total weight in the E. coli cell; and then find the number of moles present. A mole is defined as weight in (grams / mo-lecular weight) (MW) . From this, you use the fact that in one mole of any substance, (6.02 \u00d7 10^23) molecules (Avogadro's number) exist. The lipid content is given as 2%. If the total weight of the cell is (2 \u00d7 10^-12) g, the lipid molecules must have a total weight of (.02) (2 \u00d7 10^-12) or 4 \u00d7 10^-14 grams. The average molecular weight of a lipid molecule is given as 700 (g / mole). Thus, you have 4 \u00d7 10^-14 / 700 = 5.71 \u00d7 10^-17 moles of lipid molecules. If 6.02 \u00d7 10^23 mo-lecules are in a mole, then in 5.71 \u00d7 10^-17 moles, there are 6.02 \u00d7 10^23 5.71 \u00d7 10^-17 = 3.44 \u00d7 10^7 lipid molecules. (b) Calculate the volume of both the E. coli cell and the total volume occupied by the ribosomes. Volume of the E. coli cell: It is of cylindrical shape. The volume of a cylinder can be found from the product of its length and the area of its base. The area of the base, a circle. is \\pir^2 , where r = radius. Because the diamater = 2r,the radius of the cylindrical E. coli cell is 1\\mu divided by 2 or 0.5 \\mu. This is converted to 5 \u00d7 10^3 \\AA, by the conversion factor 10^4 \\AA = 1 micron. Similarly, 2\\mu = (2 \u00d7 10^4 \\AA) = length of E. coli cell. Its total volume = (area of circle) (length) = [\\pi(5 \u00d7 10^3)^2 (2 \u00d7 10^4] = 1.57 \u00d7 10^12. Volume of ribosomes: Each ribosome has a diameter of 180 \\AA or a radius of 90 \\AA. It is given that it is a sphere. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula (4 / 3 \\pi^3), where r = radius. Substituting the volume of one ribosome = (4 / 3)\\pi (90)^3 3.05 \u00d7 10^6. If there exists 15,000 ribosomes, their total volume must be (15000) (3.05 \u00d7 10^6) = 4.58 \u00d7 10^10. Therefore, the percentage volume it occupies = (total volume of ribosomes) / (volume of E. coli cell) \u00d7 100 = [(4.58 \u00d7 10^10) / (1.57 \u00d7 10^12)] \u00d7 100 = 2.9%.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E22-0784.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "3.44 \u00d7 10^7 lipid molecules, 2.9%"}

It is found that the x-rays scat-tered at an angle of less than 900, have a wavelength f ', greater than f. Interpret this result in terms of a collision of a photon with an electron.", "solution": "The collision is shown in the diagram. The photon is scat-tered through an angle \\texttheta, and the electron through an angle \\varphi. The momentum of the photon is given by the de Broglie relationship. p = h/\\lambda = hf/cusing \\lambdaf = c As in all collision problems, the law of conservation of momentum may be applied to this collision. The momentum of the photon-electron system, then must remain constant throughout the collision. Since momentum is a vector quantity, (having both direction and mag-nitude) we must resolve the momenta of the electron and photon into x and y components. Conservation of momentum can then be applied as follows: hf/c = (hf '/c)cos \\texttheta + mv cos \\varphi (x component)(1) (hf '/c)sin \\texttheta = mv sin \\varphi (y component)(2) The law of conservation of energy can also be applied to the collision analysis because the collision is elastic. The total energy of the electron- photon system must then remain constant throughout the col-lision. Or hf + m_0c^2 = hf ' + mc^2(3) where m_0 is the rest mass of the electron.

Therefore by subtracting (4) from (5) we obtain [h(f - f') + m_0c^2]^2 - h^2(f^2 + f'^2 - 2ff' cos \\texttheta) = m^2c^2(c^2 - v^2) = m2_0c^4.

If the tension in the string just vanishes at the top of the circle, what is the velocity of the body and the tension in the string (a) when the string is horizontal, and (b) when the body is at its lowest point?", "solution": "At each of the positions of the body in its rotation, only two forces act on it, the weight mg^\\ding{217} acting downward and the tension of the string , T^\\ding{217}, acting toward the center of the circle. At the top of the swing, the two forces act in the same direction and together provide the centripetal force necessary to keep the body in its circular path. Thus (see figure) by Newton's Second Law, mg + T = (mv^2)/r. When T is just zero at the top, v^2 = rg = 2 ft \u00d7 32 ft/s^2 = 64 ft^2/s^2. \\thereforev = 8 ft \\textbullet s^-1. (a) When the string is horizontal, the body has lost potential energy and gained a corresponding quantity of kinetic energy. If we refer to the diagram we have from the principle of conservation of energy. (1/2) mv^2_1 = (1/2)mv^2 + mg \u00d7 r or v^2_1 = v^2 + 2gr = 3 gr. \\thereforev_1 = 8 \\surd3ft/s = 13.86 ft/s. Here, the potential energy is taken to be zero at the height of the center of the circle. Further, T_1^\\ding{217} is the only force acting radically. Hence T1= (mv^2_1)/r = 3 mg = 3 \u00d7 1 slug \u00d7 32 ft \\textbullet s^-2 = 96 lb. (b) When the body is at its lowest point, similar arguments about gain of kinetic energy and loss of potential energy apply.

{"question": "What are some factors that interfere with our obtaining a completeand unbiased picture of life in the past from a study ofthe fossil strata?", "solution": "There are five major rock strata in the earth's crust, each of which is subdividedinto lesser strata. Theoretically, because the strata were formedby the chronological deposition of sediment, the charac-teristics of eachancient era or period should become evident upon examining the fossilcomposition of each stratum and substratum. Also, one should be ableto estimate the duration of each era or period from the thickness of eachlayer and the known rate of sediment deposition. Knowledge of the fossil strata has been useful in the past and is still beingused today in those cases when radioactive dating is not applicable. In relative dating, a time or era can be assigned to a fossil or ar-tifact relativeto other fossils or artifacts of known age in otherstata. But this viewis oversimplified. The relative length of each ancient epoch cannot, in reality, be determined in great accuracy since the rate of sedi-mentary depositionvaried at different times and in different places. While the layers ofsedimentary rock should occur in the sequence of their deposition, with thenewer, later strata on top of the older, earlier ones, geologic disturbancesat some point of history may have changed the order and relationshipof the layers. It is known that certain sections of theearth's crusthave undergone tremendousfoldingsandsplittings, and old layers maynow cover new ones. In addition, in some regions, the strata formed previouslyhave emerged from the sea due to the continuous addition of newlayers; the top layers were then very easily carried away by running wateror other natural disturbances, so that re-latively recent strata were depositeddirectly on top of very ancient ones. Such factors make it difficultfor us to obtain a complete, accurate picture of the ancient ages in chronological order.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F28-0731.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The rate of sedimentary deposition varied at different times and in different places, geologic disturbances may have changed the order and relationship of the layers, and certain sections of the earth's crust have undergone foldings and splittings, and old layers may now cover new ones."}
{"question": "A saturated solution of CaF_2 contains .00168g of CaF_2 per 100g of water. Determine theK_sp.", "solution": "When a salt is added to water, it dissociates into ions. Once a saturated solution is obtained, the addition of more salt re-sults in precipitation of the solid. In such a case, an equilibrium is established between the solid phase and the ions in solution. This equilibrium is expressed as the solubility product constant orK_sp. To determine theK_sp, you must set up an equation that expresses this equilibrium. You must also determine themolarityof the solution.Molarityrefers to the number of moles per liter of solution. The equilibrium reaction is CaF_2 (s) \\rightleftarrows Ca^2+ (aq) + 2F-(aq). The products have their oxidation states expressed because they are ions in solution. TheK_spfor the reaction is defined as K_sp= [Ca^2+] [F-]^2 . Because this is a heterogeneous equilibrium, there is no need to in-clude CaF_2 (s) in the expression forK_sp. You include only those substances with variable molar concentrations. The fluoride ion con-centration is squared because 2 moles of fluoride ion are generated in the reaction. In general, then, the exponent of the concentration will equal the number of moles of that ion that is generated. Now that theK_spis defined, determine the molarityof the solution. Sincemolarityis defined as moles of solute per liter of solution, you have M =molarity= [(.00168g) / {78g/mole (CaF_2)}] / [100 ml / (1000ml/1)] Solving, you obtain M = .214 \u00d7 10-^2 M. You will notice that the 100 grams of water do not appear in this calculation. The density of water is 1g/ml. Since Density = Mass/Volume, 100g H_2 O has a volume of 100ml.

These results are obtained because for every mole/liter of CaF_2 in solution, 1 mole/liter of Ca^2+ and 2 moles/liter of F- is obtained, Therefore, recalling K_sp= [Ca^2+] [F-]^2 , you have K_sp= (.214 \u00d7 10-^2 ) (.428 \u00d7 10-^2 )^2 = 3.92 \u00d7 10-^8 .", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E11-0393.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "3.92 \u00d7 10^-8"}

{"question": "A chemist mixes .5 moles of acetic acid (HC_2H_3O_2) and .5 moles of HCN with enough water to make a one liter solution. Calculate the final concentrations of H_3O^+ and OH^-.

The third stems from the ionization of water to hydroniumand hydroxyl ions. You have: (1) HC_2H_3O_2 + H_2O \\rightleftarrows H_3O^+ + C_2H_3O_2^- (2) HCN + H_2O \\rightleftarrows H_3O^+ + CN^- (3) H_2O + H_2O \\rightleftarrows H_3O^+ + OH^-. Each reaction contributes H_3O^+ ions. However, only the acetic acid produces an appreciable concentration of H_3O^+. This can be determined by inspection of the dissociation constants. The larger a dissociation constant, the greater the dissociation of the species. The dissociation constant of acetic acid, 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5, is the largest, and, therefore, its [H_3O^+] contribution is the greatest. As such, you can neglect the H_3O^+ contribution from HCN and water. Let the H_3O^+ contribution from acetic acid = x. If you started with a concentration of .5M for acetic acid, then, at equilibrium, it becomes .5-x.

(The retarding force in both cases is assumed constant.)", "solution": "The wood exerts a constant retarding force F^\\ding{217} on the bullet. The work this force does on the bullet is equal to its change in kinetic energy in accordance with the work-energy theorem. This work is given by W = F^\\ding{217}\\bullet S^\\ding{217}(1) where s^\\ding{217} is the distance the bullet penetrates the block. Since the force acts in a direction opposite to the path of motion of the bullet, equation (1) reduces to W = - Fs In the first case, all of the bullet's kinetic energy is converted to heat due to the work done on it by the re-tarding force. If the distance the bullet penetrates the block is d_1, then the work done on it is W_1 = - Fd_1 = (1/2)mv2_1 - (1/2)mv^2 = 0 - (1/2) mv^2 = - (1/2) mv^2 Fd_1 = (1/2)mv^2(2) where v is the bullet's initial velocity and v_1 is the bullet's final velocity, which equals zero since the bullet comes to rest in the block. In the second case, the bullet's final velocity, v_2,is not zero. Even after it stops inside the block, it has a speed since the block is now free to move and the bullet moves with it. Since there are no external forces acting on the system, the principle of conservation of momentum can be applied. This is an inelastic collision where the block and bullet move together with the same final velocity, v_2.If the bullet's mass is represented by m and that of the block by M, then we have mv= (m + M)v_2(3) where v has the same significance as before. Further, the work done by the retarding force in stopping the bullet over a distance d_2, must equal the total change in kinetic energy of the system. W_2 = - Fd_2 = (1/2) (m + M)v^2 _2 - (1/2) mv^2(4) Solving for v_2 in equation (3) and substituting into equation (4) - Fd_2 = (1/2) (m + M) [(mv) / (m + M)]^2 - (1/2) mv^2 Fd_2 = (1/2) mv^2 - (1/2) [m2/ (m + M)] v^2(5) Dividing equation (5) by (2), We obtain Fd2/ Fd_1 = [(1/2) mv^2 - (1/2) {m^2/(m + M)} v^2] / [ (1/2) mv^2] (d2/ d_1) = [m - {m^2/(m + M)}] / m = [{(m^2 +mM- m^2)/(m + M)} / m] = M/(m + M) Substituting the known values, we have for the distance d_2 that the second bullet penetrates d_2 = (m d_1)/(m + M) = [(1kg)(0.1 m)] / [(0.01 kg + 1kg)] = (0.1)/(1.01) m = 0.099m = 9.9cm", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Physics/D06-0331.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "9.9cm"}

Assume density = .79 g/ml for ethyl alcohol (C_2H_5OH) andK_f= 1.86\\textdegreeC/m for water.", "solution": "To findmolarity, mole fraction, andmolality, you need to know how many moles of alcohol are present in the whiskey. You can obtain this from a calculation using the density. To find whether you can still drink the whisky at - 10\\textdegreeC, requires you to know its freezing point, since you cannot drink something if it is frozen. You can deter mine the freezing point of the Scotch by determining the freezing point depression of the water containing the alcohol. This is found from\\DeltaT_f=K_fm, where\\DeltaT_f= the depression,K_f= freezing point depression constant, and m =molality. You now proceed as follows: You are told that 100 proof means 50 percent alcohol by volume. This means that 1 liter of components possess 500 cm^3 of ethyl alcohol (a liter = 1000 cm^3). Density = mass/volume. You know the density and volume, so that mass of alcohol = density \u00d7 volume = .79(500) = 395 g. Molecular wt. of the alcohol = 46.07 g. Thus, you have 395/46.07 = 8.57 moles of alcohol. Hence, molarity= [(moles of solute)/(liters of solution)] = 8.57 / 1 = 8.57 M. Molarity= [(moles of solute)/(kilograms of solvent)]. To find the number of grams of solvent, you need to use the density again. In 1 liter of Scotch Whisky, you have 500 cm^3 of water. Density of water = 1 g/ cm^3. Thus, mass of water = 500 cm^3 (1 g/ cm^3) = 500 grams. Thus, Molality= [(8.57) / {(500/1000)}] = 17.14 m You divided 500 by 1000 sincemolalityis moles per 1000 g of solvent. Mole fraction: (MW of H_2O =18.) moles of H_2O = 500 g/18.0 g/mole. Mole fraction of ethyl alcohol = [(moles ethyl alcohol)/(moles ethyl alcohol + moles H_2O)] = [(8.57) / {8.57 + (500/18)}] = .2357.

{"question": "Explain why blood is such an important tissue in many animals. Discuss the major functions of blood.", "solution": "All cells, in order to survive, must obtain the necessary raw materials for metabolism, and have a means for the removal of waste products. In small plants and animals living in an aquatic environment, these needs are provided for by simple diffusion. The cells of such organisms are very near the external watery medium, and so nutrients and wastes do not have a large distance to travel. However, as the size of the organism increases, more and more cells become further removed from the media bathing the peripheral cells. Diffusion cannot provide sufficient means for transport. In the absence of a specialized transport system, the limit on the size of an aerobic organism would be about a millimeter, since the diffusion of oxygen and nutrients over great distances would be too slow to meet the metabolic needs of all the cells of the organism. In addition, without internal transport, or-ganisms are restricted to watery environments, since the movement to land requires an efficient system for material exchange in non-aqueous surroundings. Therefore, larger animals have developed a system of internal transport, the circulatory system. This system, consisting of an exten-sive network of various vessels, provides each cell with an opportunity to exchange materials by diffusion. Blood is the vital tissue in the circulatory system, transporting nutrients and oxygen to all the cells and removing carbon dioxide and other wastes from them. Blood also serves other important functions. It transports hormones, the secretions of the endocrine glands, which affect organs sensitive to them. Blood also acts to regulate the acidity and alkalinity of the cells via control of their salt and water content. In addition, the blood acts to regulate the body temperature by cooling certain organs and tissues when an excess of heat is produced (such as in exercising muscle) and warming tissues where heat loss is great (such as in the skin). Some components of the blood act as a defense against bacteria, viruses and other pathogenic (disease-causing) organisms. The blood also has a self-preservation system called a clotting mechanism so that loss of blood due to vessel rupture is reduced.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F14-0344.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Blood is the vital tissue in the circulatory system, transporting nutrients and oxygen to all the cells and removing carbon dioxide and other wastes from them.

{"question": "Describe the curve one would obtain by plotting pressure versus volume for an ideal gas in which the temperature and number of moles of gas are held constant.", "solution": "This problem requires a plot of the ideal gas equation. This equation reads PV = nRT, where P = pressure of gas, V = volume of gas, n = number of moles of gas, R = gas constant, and T = absolute tem-perature of gas.

Plotting P on the abscissa axis and V on the ordinate axis, we obtain the following curve: Note: Even if we did not know PV = k is the graph of a hyperbola, we could still obtain this graph.

Assume the following: the ionization potential of Cs = 3.89eV, h = 6.63 \u00d7 10^-34 J sec, and Cs metal is sensitive to red light of 700 nm.", "solution": "This problem entails the understanding of the photoelectric effect. The photoelectric effect states that when one shines light of a given frequency on a metallic material, electrons will be emitted. The equation: E =hv(where E = energy, v = frequency, and h = Planck's constant) determines the amount of energy produced by a given frequency of light. The ionization potential is the amount of energy needed to cause the electrons to be ejected from the metal. To solve this problem, there-fore , one must calculate how much energy is present in light with a wavelength of 700 nm and then compare this to the ionization potential of a Cs atom. It is given that the wavelength of the light is 700 nm. The frequency of this light is equal to speed of light/wavelength = (3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) / 700 \u00d7 10^-9 m. Thus, E = (6.63 \u00d7 10^-34 J sec) [(3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) / (700 \u00d7 10^-9 m)] = 2.84 \u00d7 10^-19 J/photon 1eV= 1.60 \u00d7 10^-19 J. The ionization energy is 3.89eVor (3.89eV) (1.60 \u00d7 10^-19 J/eV) = 6.22 \u00d7 10^-19 J. Because Cs is sensitive to light with a wavelength of 700 nm, one photon of this light flashed on the metal Cs will cause 1 electron to be emitted from the Cs. Therefore, the number of electrons emitted when 6.22 \u00d7 10^-19 J, (the ionization potential of an isolated Cs atom), is added to the metallic system is found by dividing 6.22 \u00d7 10^-19 J by 2.84 \u00d7 10^-19 J no. of electrons emitted = [(6 22 \u00d7 10^-19 J) / (2.84 \u00d7 10^-19 J)] = 2.2 electrons Therefore, the maximum number of electrons that can be emitted is 2.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E18-0691.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "2"}

The osmotic pressure of a solutionis a measure of the tendency of the solvent to enter the solu-tion byosmosis. The more concentrated a solution, the more water will tend to moveinto it, and the higher is its osmotic pressure.

{"question": "A corporate executive who is slowly embezzling money from thecompany's pension fund has instructed his partner in crime, an investment banker, to send all correspondence in code. The computer operators on his staff type the corres-pondenceon cards, each card containing 60 characters. To decode the message, you must first divide up the stringinto 5 blocks containing 12 characters each, with every twelfthcharacter used to build a word. In addition, each letter isto be replaced with the letter six ahead of it in the alphabet. Thus, A becomes G, B becomes H, and U becomesA, V becomes B, and so on. Write a procedure inPL/Ito read the characters from cards, decode the characters of each card, and print the 12 outputwords, four per line. The program should terminate whena card contains all consonants (consider Y to be a con-sonant) .", "solution": "To complete this program, we make use of the INDEX, VARYING andSUBSTR functions, three built-in routines useful for handling characters. We shall go through the program, explaining the implementationof each of these functions in the program. In the declaration section, we use the VARYING attribute to adjust thelength of the string. Based on the number of characters in the string, eachelement in the array having less than 5 characters will not be padded withblanks. IfWORD(12) were 'QOR', it would be stored just as is. Without the VARYING (VAR for short) attribute,WORD(12) would contain 'QOR '. After this we have a section which determines if the mes-sage is complete. Here we use the INDEX function. This is a powerful tool which searchesa character string to determine whether a specified character or combinationof characters is contained there. The five IF statements check tosee if any vowels are contained in the strings. If not found, a value of 0 isreturned to the program, and the next step is execut-ed. If it is found, INDEX returns a single integer indicating the number of the character wherethe match begins. This section causes the program to terminate if thecard contains all consonants. The statement in which characters are replaced deserves special attention. First, the double bar symbol stands for the concatenation operation. Its function is to connect two character strings to form a single, longerone. In this statement,WORD(J) is attached to a lengthy expression, be-ginning with the substring function SUBSTR. Let us digress for a moment to explain the SUBSTR func-tion. The generalform of this function is SUBSTR (a, n) where a is the name of a characterstring variable, and n is any numerical expression that produces apositive integer. It examines the string in a, reaches the nth character, andpulls from the string all characters, including the nth one, to the right. Say we have stored in WORD the characters 'WDPSO'. If we write NEWWORD =SUBSTR(WORD,3), the variable NEWWORD will contain thesubstring 'PSO'. We can even insert a third argument into the SUBSTR function, which has the same restric-tions as n, to indicate the lastcharacter we wish to remove. Now, the section of the statement following the \\vert\\vert symbol cam be explained. Character string ALP is the string which contains the master code. The INDEX function determines the number of the character to be moved, while the inner SUBSTR function finds the character in the string. The integer 6 is added to the number returned by the INDEX function to assigna letter six ahead of it in the alphabet. This is done to each characterin sequence.

Calculate in each case the principal quantum number of the orbit to which the electron in the hydrogen atom is raised and the wavelength of the radiation emitted if it drops back to the ground state.", "solution": "Bohr theory relates the wavelength of the radiation emitted by a hydrogen atom to the principal quantum numbers of the energy levels involved by the equation (1/\\lambda) = R [(1/n^2_1) - (1/n^2_2)] or f = (c/\\lambda) =Rc[(1/n^2_1) - (1/n^2_2)], where c is the speed of light, f is the frequency of the radiation and R is theRydbergconstant. The energy of the quantum of radiation emitted is E =hf=Rch[(1/n^2_1) - (1/n^2_2)]. (Here, h isPlahcK'sconstant.) This is the energy emitted in the form of a quantum of radiation when the electron drops from the orbit characterized by the quantum number n_2 to that character-ized by the quantum number n_1 If the electron is raised from the orbit with quantum number n_1 to the orbit with quantum number n_2, it must absorb an equal amount of energy. Before being struck by an electron, a hydrogen atom will be in the ground state with n_1 = 1. It is, in any case, true that if n_1 had a value higher than 1, then E, the absorbed energy, could not be greater than 3.40eV, the limiting energy for n_1 =2 . Thus, if E has the values 10.20eV, 12.09 eV, and 13.06eV, the atom absorbing these energies from the incoming electrons, then E =Rch[(1/n^2_1) - (1/n^2_2)].

The weight of oxygen in the reaction can be determined by using the Law of Conservation of Mass. This law states that there is no detectable gain or loss of mass in a chemical change.

{"question": "Explain what occurs during the human \"birth process\" and when these phenomena take place.", "solution": "The actual process of birth is preceded by the gestation period. The gestation period or duration of pregnancy varies in different species. It normally lasts about 280 days in humans (the time of the last menstrual period to the birth of the baby). Little is known about the factors that initiate the birth process, or parturition, after gestation is complete, but it is believed that hormon-al factors play an important role. It has been found ex-perimentally in mice that the level of progesterone in the blood declines sharply, while that of estrogen rises short-ly before parturition. The start of parturition is marked by a long series of involuntary uterine contractions called \"labor pains\" Labor is divided into three periods. The first lasts about twelve hours. The fetus is moved down toward the cervix which becomes dilated to enable the fetus to pass through. The amnion ruptures, releasing the amniotic fluid through the vagina. The second period is the birth, where the fetus passes through the cervix and vagina and is \"delivered.\" This stage takes about twenty minutes to an hour, and consists of combined involuntary uterine contractions and voluntary contractions of the abdomen by the mother. The last stage of labor begins after birth and lasts for ten to fifteen minutes. The placenta and the fetal membranes are loosened from the uterine lining by another series of contractions and expelled as the after--birth. Sometimes, a woman will require more help than usual during childbirth. Drugs such as oxytocin and prosta-glandins will help increase the uterine contractions.

Now, we establish that positive y is the vertical direction upwards. If M_0 is the total mass of rocket and fuel before the launch, and m is the mass of the exiting fuel jet, then the rate of change in momentum is given by: F = (d/dt)(MV) + (V -V_e) (dm/dt) We must also take into account the force of gravity, which is acting against the motion of the rocket. The formula will not be derived step-by-step here; a text on differential equations will have the thorough explanation. However, all variables will be explained, after presenting the general equation. The initial condition v = 0 at t = 0 yields the equation: V = -gt-V_eln[(m_0 -ut) / u] then, by integrating, the equation of motion is obtained, which expresses the height y as a function of time t: y = -(1/2)gt2+V_e[t + {( m_0 -ut) / u} 1n {(m_0 -ut) / m_0}] The variables are as follows: y = vertical height; -(1/2)gt^2 = the effect of gravity pulling the rocket downward; hence the use of the negative sign.

{"question": "Suppose the collision in the figure is completely inelastic and that the masses and velocities have the values shown. What is the velocity of the 2 mass system after the collision? What is the kinetic energy before and after the collision?", "solution": "Since we wish to relate the final velocity of the system to its initial velocity, we will use conservation of momentum The total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision, if no forces external to the system act. Hence m_Av^\\ding{217}_Ai + m_Bv^\\ding{217}_Bi = (m_A + m_B)v^\\ding{217} where v^\\ding{217}_Ai, v^\\ding{217}_Bi are the initial velocities of m_A and m_B, and v^\\ding{217} is the final velocity of the combined masses. Solv-ing for v, v^\\ding{217} = (m_Av^\\ding{217}_Ai + m_Bv^\\ding{217}_Bi) / (m_A + m_B) Changing the vectors to magnitudes, and noting that v^\\ding{217}_Ai and v^\\ding{217}_Bi are in the opposite directions v = (m_A v_Ai - m_Bv_Bi) / (mA+ m_B) where v_Ai is in the positive x direction. Therefore, v = [(5 kg)(2 m/s) - (3 kg)( 2 m/s)] / [8 kg] v = .5 m/s Since v_2 is positive, the system moves to the right after the collision. The kinetic energy of body A before the collision is (1/2) m_Av^2 _Ai = (1/2)(5 kg)(4 m^2/s^2) = 10 joules and that of body B is (1/2) m_Bv^2_Bi = (1/2)(3 kg)(4 m^2/s^2) = 6 joules The total kinetic energy before collision is there-fore 16 joules. Note that the kinetic energy of body B is positive, although its velocity vBi and its momentum mv_Bi are both negative. The kinetic energy after the collision is (1/2) (m_A + m_B)v^2 = (1/2) (8 kg) (.25 m^2/s^2) = 1 joule Hence, far from remaining constant, the final kinetic energy is only 1/16 of the original, and 15/16 is \"lost\" in the collision. If the bodies couple together like two freight cars, most of this energy is converted to heat through the production of elastic waves which are eventually absorbed. If there is a spring between the bodies and the bodies are locked together when their velocities be-come equal, the energy is trapped as potential energy in the compressed spring. If all these forms of energy are taken into account, the total energy of the system is conserved although its kinetic energy is not.

{"question": "What is the nature of a \"transforming agent\"? What importance may this phenomenon have on our understanding of the chemical basis of inheritance?", "solution": "The concept of transformation arises from the experiments performed by Griffith in 1928. It was observed that when injected into mice, some strains of pneumococcus bacteria caused pneumonia and usually death. Other strains of the bacteria, were relatively harmless. The infective form always had a capsule (a complicated polysaccharide coating). The non-infective form did not have a virulent capsule. The encapsulated strain was called the \"smooth strain\" because the colonies looked smooth on a culture plate, and the harmless, unencapsulated strain was called the \"rough strain\" because of the rough appearance of its colonies. In his famous experiment, Griffith injected one group of mice with the virulent smooth strain and another with the harmless rough strain. As expected, mice from the former group died while the latter group survived. Griffith then injected a third group of mice with the heat-killed smooth strain. This group lived, showing that bacteria killed by heat were no longer virulent. However, when a fourth group of mice was injected simul-taneously with both the harmless rough strain and the heat- killed smooth bacteria, the mice died. The disease- causing organisms were of the smooth type bacteria. This process, by which something from the heat killed bacteria converted rough bacteria into smooth bacteria, is known as transformation. Griffith felt that protein from the dead bacteria might be the active transforming agent. But Griffith's interpretation of his experiment was later shown to be incorrect by Avery, MacLeod, and McCarthy in 1944. They made an extract from heat-killed smooth cells, and purified the extract by removing any substance that did not cause transformation of rough bacteria into smooth bacteria. Eventually they determined that DNA was the essential transforming agent. Moreover, when this extracted DNA was added to other types of rough strains, the bacteria formed from transformation were always identical to the bacteria that donated the DNA. This indicated that he-reditary information must be carried by DNA. Transformation suggests that in bacteria, genetic traits can be passed via DNA alone, from one bacterium to another.", "images": ["images/F24-0609_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F24-0609.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "DNA is the essential transforming agent.

For an acid, HA., Ka = {[H^+] [A^-]}/[HA] , where Ka is the ionization constant, [H^+] is the concentration of H^+ ions, [A^- ] is the concentration of the conjugate base ions and [HA ] is the concentration of unionized acid. The Ka for acetic acid is stated as Ka = {[H^+] [acetate ion]}/[acetic acid] = 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5 . The chemical formula for acetic acid is HC_2H_3O_2 . When it is ionized, one H^+ is formed and one C_2H_3O^- (acetate) is formed, thus the concentration of H^+ equals the concentration of C_2H_3O^- . [H^+] = [C_2H_3O^-] . The concentration of unionized acid is decreased when ionization occurs. The new concentration is equal to the concentration of H^+ subtracted from the concentration of unionized acid. [HC_2H_3O] = 0.10 - [H^+] . Since [H^+] is small relative to 0.10, one may assume that 0.10 -[H^+] is approximately equal to 0.10. 0.10 - [H^+] \\cong 0.10 . Using this assumption, and the fact that [H^+] = [C_2H_3O^-] can berewriteen as Ka = {[H^+] [H^+]}/(0.10) = 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5 .

{"question": "Discuss the action of enzymes in intestinal digestion.", "solution": "Digestion and absorption of ingested food takes place mainly in the small intestine. The partially digested food that enters the upper part of the small intestine (the duodenum) from the stomach is very acidic, due to the high acid content of the stomach. This acidity stimulates special receptor cells in the intestinal lining. These cells, in turn, produce a hormone, cholecystokinin (CCK) that enhances the release of bile from the gall Digestion of protein. Pepsin in the stomach hydrolyzes peptide bonds at the amino end of tyrosine (Tyr) and phenylalanine (Phe). Then the food moves into the intestine, where trypsin and chymotrypsin from the pancreas hydrolyze bondsadjacent to lysine and arginine and to tyrosine, leucine, and phenylalanine, respectively (chymotrypsin also hydrolyzes bonds adjacent to tryptophan and methionine when they are present). Pepsin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin hydrolyze only internal bonds, not bonds attaching terminal amino acids to the chains. Terminal bonds at the amino end of chains may be split by aminopeptidase and those at the carboxyl end by carboxpeptidase. Bonds between pairs of amino acids are split by dipeptidases whereupon digestion is completed. bladder. CCK also stimulates the release of a pancreatic juice rich in digestive enzymes (proteases, lipase, nucle-ases and amylase). Secretin, also produced by the intes-tinal mucosa, causes release of a pancreatic juice rich in sodium bicarbonate, which neutralizes the stomach acid. Proteases are enzymes that hydrolyze proteins, which are long chains of amino acids joined together by peptide bonds. Generally, short chains of amino acids are called polypeptides. The intestinal proteases are usually called peptidases because they break the peptide bonds of peptide chains. There are many different kinds of peptidases (see figure). Pepsin, produced in the stomach, is an endopeptidase; it cleaves only those peptide bonds that are within the peptide chain, splitting the large chain into many shorter chains. Trypsin and chymotrypsin are the endopeptidases produced by the pancreas. Unlike pepsin, which requires the high acidity of the stomach in order to function, these intestinal enzymes prefer an alkaline environment. Like pepsin of the stomach, these enzymes will only break the peptide bonds between certain amino acids. Trypsin will split the bond linking the amino acids lysine or arginine. Chymotrypsin cleaves the peptide bonds next to phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan. The second category of peptidases are the exopeptidases. Exopeptidases only attack the ends of the peptide. The many peptides produced as the result of endopeptidase ac-tivity provide numerous sites for attack by the exopeptidases. The two ends of a peptide chain are chemically different. One end is called the amino end(-NH2) while the other is the carboxylic end (-COOH). Thus, there are two kinds of exopeptidases: aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase. These enzymes sure secreted by glands in the intestinal lining and the pancreas, respectively. When digestion of a protein is completed by these enzymes, all that remains are the free amino acids, which are taken up by the cells lining the villi. Lipase, produced by the pancreas, digests the lipids in our food, with the help of the bile. Two other pancreatic enzymes, ribonuclease and deoxyribonuclease, break up any RNA and DNA from the nuclei of the cells we ingest. The products of their digestion are quickly absorbed through the Villi. Pancreatic amylase breaks up any remaining starch into maltose. In addition to aminopeptidase, the intestinal glands secrete enzymes which degrade sugars. Maltase splits maltose into two glucose molecules; sucrase splits sucrose into glu-cose and fructose; and lactase splits lactose into glucose and galactose molecules.", "images": ["images/F17-0432_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F17-0432.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Digestion and absorption of ingested food takes place mainly in the small intestine.

{"question": "The property of skeletal muscle contraction in which the mechanical response to one or more successive stimuli is added to the first is known as summation. What is the underlying explanation for this phenomenon?", "solution": "A possible explanation of this phenomenon, based on the role of calcium in excitation-contraction coupling, is that the amount of calcium released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum during a single action poten-tial is sufficient to inhibit only some of the troponin-tropomyosin in the muscle. Multiple stimulation would then release more calcium so that more troponin-tropomyosin would be inhibited, allowing for further contraction. However, the truth is that more than enough calcium is released by the first action potential to inhibit all the troponin-tropomyosin, so this proposal must be discarded. The explanation of summation involves the passive elastic properties of the muscle. Tension is transmitted from the cross bridges through the thick and thin fila-ments, across the Z lines, and eventually through the extracellular connective tissue and the tendons to the bone. All these structures have a certain amount of elasticity, analogous to a spring that is placed between the contractile components of the muscle and the external object. In the muscle, the contractile elements in their fully active state begin to stretch the passive elastic structures immediately following calcium release. Only when the elastic structures are all taut, can increasing contraction by the muscle occur. Summation occurs because a second stimulus is given, very close in time to the first, while the elastic structures are still a bit taut and not yet slack. Under this condition, the active state of the contractile proteins is maintained and the result is contractions that are stronger than any single simple twitch. Should sustained stimulation occur, the elastic elements would never have time to relax at all, and it is at this point that maximal force by the muscle fibers is attained; the individual contractions are indistinquishably fused into a single sustained contraction known as tetanus, (see accompanying figure) If stimula-tion of the muscle continues at this frequency, the ulti-mate result will be fatigue and possibly complete cessation of activity due to exhaustion of nutrients. It is not surprising to note that cardiac muscle has an extremely long refractory period, allowing the elastic components to relax and thus avoiding tetanus, which would result in death due to loss of pumping action of the heart.", "images": ["images/F19-0473_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F19-0473.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Summation occurs because a second stimulus is given, very close in time to the first, while the elastic structures are still a bit taut and not yet slack.

{"question": "A boy sits in a bus holding a balloon by a string. The bus accelerates forward. In which direction will the balloon move?", "solution": "Our first guess is that the balloon moves backward. However, the balloon actually moves forward. This occurs due to the pressure gradient created by the motion of the bus. When the bus is at rest, the air molecules undergo random motions. On the average the molecules remain in one position. As the bus accelerates, the back of the bus \"collects\" the air molecules. The front of the bus leaves the air molecules behind. The net result is an increase in air density at the back of the bus, and a decrease in air density at the front. Just as a balloon rises due to the greater pressure at the lower end of the balloon than at the top of the balloon, similarly the greater pressure at the back of the balloon will cause it to move forward.", "images": ["images/D10-0397_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Physics/D10-0397.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "The balloon moves forward"}

Thus, for this reaction the rate law can be written Rate = k [H_2][I_2], where k is the rate constant and [ ] indicates concentration. When 1 mole of each H_2 and I_2 are used, one can solve for the rate by substituting these values into the rate law. Rate = k (1)(1) = 1k Solving for the rate when [H_2] is 2 moles Rate = k[2][1] = 2k Thus, when the concentration of H_2 is doubled the rate is doubled. (b)One can solve for the rate when [I_2] = 2 moles by substituting into the rate law. Rate = k(1) (2) = 2 k Thus when [I_2] doubled the rate is also doubled. (c)Boyle's law states that the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume. Thus, when this reaction which originally takes place in a 1-liter box is moved to a 2- liter box, the pressure of the reactants is halved. Solving for the rate: Rate = k (1/2) (1/2) = 1/4 kor.25 k.

Due to the presence of HCl in the stomach as a hydrolysis agent, the acidity of the stomach is high, which means an environment of low pH exists. It becomes doubtful that these proteolytic enzymes would have much activity at the low pH of the stomach. This means that little, if any, damage would be done to the stomach.

{"question": "Write a pseudocoded program to find an approximation of pi using the Monte Carlo method. This method is an example of a system which uses random digits to solve a problem that does not, by itself, have ran-domness.", "solution": "First, we must assume that there is a subprogram called RANDOM available in the user's compiler. Different compilers have different means of obtaining random digits, so we omit a discussion of the actual process of randomization. Monte Carlo methods typically use random digits to solve problems which have no inherently random properties. For the approximation of pi, we need the dart board analogy. We have a square board with an inscribed circle, as in Fig. 1. Suppose we have monkeys that have been trained to toss darts at the board. Now, assuming all the darts land somewhere on the board, and assuming that a dart can land anywhere with equal likelihood, we ask: what is the probability that a dart will land inside the circle? If you remember the equations for the areas of a circle and a square (A = \\pi(L/2)^2 and A = L^2, respectively), you can discover that the probability equals the ratio of the circle's area to the square's area, or \\pi/4, which is about 0.7854. For our example, we do not know \\pi. However, if we could get the monkeys to throw a large number of darts at the board, we could compute the proportion of hits falling inside the circle. From this proportion, we can find an approximation for \\pi. The following pseudocode generates randomly the X- and Y- coordinates of each \"dart\" thrown at the board. Since these coordinates lie between 0 and 1, darts appear only in the positive quadrant of the square (the top right corner). However, the full figure can be built from four identical pieces, so the result remains the same. We just multiply \\pi/4 by 4 to get the desired result. Also note that if we increase the number of darts thrown, the degree of deviation from the expected result decreases. This axiom is called in statistics the \"law of large numbers\". We are testing for 4-digit accuracy in this problem. Our output consists of the number of darts, the approximate value of \\pi, and the deviation from the expected result.

{"question": "There exists a carbohydrate that is slightly soluble in water, does not have a sweet taste, but does dissolve slowly when heated with diluteHCl.

Carbohydrates are placed in three classes: (1)Mono-saccharides- those that do not undergo hydrolysis; (2) Disaccharides - those that may be hydrolyzed to two monosaccharide molecules; and (3) Polysaccharides - those which form many monosaccharide molecules after hydrolysis. It is given that the carbohydrate dissolves in diluteHCl. Thus, one can immediately eliminatemono-saccharidesas a possible case. The fact that it dissolves whenHClis present suggests that a hydrolysis reaction has taken place. Only disaccharides and polysaccharides have the ability to undergo such a reaction. Thus, the carbohydrate belongs to either the class of disaccharides or polysaccharides. To determine which one it is, use the information that it is not sweet or very soluble in water. The more carbons in a molecule the more unlikely it will be soluble in water. Carbon -carbon bonds arenonpolar, while water is a polar molecule. Thus, a polysaccharide, which possesses many more non-polar bonds than a disaccharide, should have a tendency to be less soluble in water. Note also that among the disaccharides exist the very sweet sugars of sucrose (table sugar), maltose (malt sugar), and lactose (milk sugar).

{"question": "How may the gene pool be altered?", "solution": "The total genetic material of a given population is termed the gene pool. The Hardy-Weinberg principle tells us that the relative gene frequencies within the gene pool of a population will remain constant from generation to generation unless certain factors alter the equilibrium of gene frequencies in the gene pool. Such factors include mutation, natural selection, migration, random genetic drift, and meiotic drive. Mutations can change one allele to another, such as A to a, and if they are recurrent or ''one-way', the relative frequencies of the two alleles will be changed by an increase in the proportion of a at the expense of A. Owing to the low mutation rate of most genes, such direct change in allelic frequency alone probably does not cause significant change in the gene pool. More important is the fact that mutations are a source of new genes, and thus traits, within a population. Together with sexual reproduction, which creates new combinations of existing genes, mutations provide the variation which is the basis for the operation of natural selection. Selection is the nonrandom differential retaining of favored genotypes. Unlike mutation, which operates directly on a gene to alter its frequency, selection indirectly alters a gene's frequency by acting on its carriers as a function of their ability to reproduce viable offspring. For example, if individuals carrying gene A are more successful in reproduction than indivi-duals carrying gene B, the frequency of the former gene will tend to increase generation after generation at the expense of the latter. Any trait which gives an organism a better chance at survival in a given environment, will increase that organism's ability to grow and reproduce, and increase the proportion of the gene for that trait in the gene pool. By the same token, any gene which confers a disadvantage to its carrier within its environment will decrease that organism's chance of survival to reproductive age, and thus decrease the frequency of that gene in the gene pool. This is the principle underlying natural selection. Migration acts both directly and indirectly to alter gene frequencies. Directly, a population may receive alleles through immigration of individuals from a nearby population. The effectiveness of immigration in changing allelic frequencies is dependent on two factors: the difference in gene frequencies between the two populations and the proportion of migrant genes that are incorporated. Alternatively, there can be emigration of members from a population, which, depending on the size of the emigration and whether or not it is selective, can result in a change in allelic frequencies in the gene pool. Indirectly, migration acts as a source of variation, similar to mutation, upon which the forces of natural selection can operate. Migration can also enhance natural selection within a population by upsetting the equilibrium that may exist among the given genotypes in a population, concerning an advantage by sheer numbers to a given group. It can blur the effects of natural se-lection by replacing genes removed by selection. Allelic frequencies may fluctuate purely by chance about their mean from generation to generation. This is termed random genetic drift. Its effect on the gene pool of a large population is negligible, but in a small effectively interbreeding population, chance alteration inMendelianratios can have a significant effect on gene frequencies, and may lead to the fixation of one allele and loss of another. For example, isolated communities within a given population have been found to have dif-ferent frequencies for blood group alleles than the population as a whole. Chance fluctuations in allelic frequency presumably caused these changes. Another factor that may alter allelic frequencies is meiotic drive. This is the term for preferential segregation of genes that may occur in meiosis. For example, if a particular chromosome is continually segregated to the polar body in femalegametogenesis, its genes would tend to be excluded from the gene pool since the polar bodies are nonfunctional and will disintegrate. There is significant evidence that, due to physical differences between certain homologous chromosomes, preferential selection of one over the other often occurs at other than random proportions.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F26-0697.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The gene pool may be altered by factors such as mutation, natural selection, migration, random genetic drift, and meiotic drive."}

{"question": "What are lichens? Describe the relationship that exist in a lichen. How do they reproduce?", "solution": "Lichens are composite organisms consisting of algae and fungi. They grow on tree bark, rocks and other substrates not suitable for the growth of plants. Lichens may be found in low-temperature environments characteristic of polar regions and very high altitudes. Structurally, a lichen can be likened to a fungal \"sandwich\" whose hyphae entwine a layer of algal cells (See figure). Structures known as rhizoids, which are short twisted strands of fungal hyphae, serve to attach the bottom layer to the substrate. Not all species of algae or all species of fungi can enter into a lichenlike relationship. Most of the fungi found in lichens are Ascomycetes, although there are a few of the Basidiomycetes. Algae of the lichens are from the Cyanophyta (blue-green algae) or the Chlorophyta (green algae) phylum. Each lichen thallus consists of a single species of fungus associated with a single species of alga. There are two types of lichens: fruticose and crustaceous. The fruticose have an erect, shrublike morphology. The crustaceous are very closely attached to the substrate or may even grow within its surface. Lichens are the product of a relationship called symbiosis, in which each partner of the association derives something useful from the other for its survival. The algae provides the fungus with food, especially carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis, and possibly vitamins as well. The fungus absorbs, stores and supplies water and minerals required by the alga, as well as providing protection and a supporting framework for the alga. Lichens appear to reproduce in a variety of ways. Fragmentation may occur, in which bits of the thallus are broken off from the parent plant and produce new lichens when they fall on a suitable substrate. Lichens may produce \"reproductive bodies\" called soredia which are knots of hyphae containing a few algal cells. In addition, the algal and fungal components of a lichen may reproduce independently of each other. The fungal com-ponent produces ascospores and the algal component re produces by cell division or infrequently via sporulation. Some species of lichens in the Arctic have been alive for 4,500 years which suggests a very well balanced association between the symbionts. Lichen grow very slowly because of their low metabolic rate. They are also very resistant to heat and desiccation. Lichens produce many interesting organic products. Unusual fats and phenolic compounds make up from two to twenty percent of the dry weight of the lichen body. Litmus, the pigment indicator, and essential oils used in perfumes are obtained from lichens.", "images": ["images/F06-0170_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F06-0170.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Lichens are composite organisms consisting of algae and fungi.

{"question": "A student wanted to produce a sample of lactic acid. He carried out the following synthesis: CH_3CH_2CO_2H \\rightarrow CH_3CHCICO_2H \\rightarrow CH_3CHOHCO_2H. He obtained a product that appeared to be lactic acid, and yet, it was optically inactive. Does this mean the product was not truly lactic acid?", "solution": "A carbon atom that has four different atoms or groups attached to it is termed an asymmetric carbon atom or a chiral center. These four groups can give two spatial arrangements, whose relationship to each other is that of an object and its mirror image. For example, see the accompanying figure. The two arrangements are not identi-cal, because they are not superimposable. In such cases, these molecules,i.e. those which differ only in the positioning of groups around asymmetric carbon atoms, are called optical isomers. Such isomers can rotate plane polarized light. Plane polarized light vibrates in only one plane. When substances can rotate plane polarized light, they are optically active. Each of the two optical isomers rotates the light in a different direction. The dextrorotary isomer rotates it to the right, while the levorotatory rotates it to the left. If both isomers are present in equal amounts, the light will not be rotated at all. For one rotates it to the left and the other rotates it to the right, which means there is a cancellation of the rotations. When plane-polarized light is not rotated, the solution is optically inactive. With this information, one can now answer the question. The student formed CH_3CHOHCO_2H, which he believed was lactic acid. The solution was optically inactive, and yet, it is known that lactic acid is optically active. The only possible explanation for this is that the student formed equal amounts of the two possible optical isomers. As mentioned, this results in optical inactivity. There is every reason to believe that formed in equal amounts. The star (\\textasteriskcentered) indicates the asymmetric carbon. Thus, the student did form lactic acid.

{"question": "The ballistic pendulum (see figure) is a device for mea-suring the velocity of a bullet. The bullet is allowed to make a completely inelastic collision with a body of much greater mass. Find the bullet's velocity before the collision.", "solution": "The momentum of the bullet-block system immediately after the collision equals the original momentum of the bullet since the block is initially at rest. Although the ballistic pendulum has now been super-seded by other devices, it is still an important labora-tory experiment for illustrating the concepts of momentum and energy. In the figure, the pendulum, consisting perhaps of a large wooden block of mass m', hangs vertically by two cords. A bullet of mass m traveling with a velocity v, strikes the pendulum and remains embedded in it. If the collision time is very small compared with the time of swing of the pendulum, the supporting cords remain practically vertical during this time. Hence no external horizontal forces act on the system during the collision, and the horizontal momentum is conserved. Then, if V represents the velocity of bullet and block immediately after the collision, mv = (m + m')V, by the principle of conservation of momentum. Hence V = mv/(m + m')(1) The kinetic energy of the system, immediately after the collision, is E_k = (1/2) (m + n')V^2. The pendulum now swings to the right and upward until all of its kinetic energy is converted to gravitational potential energy. (Small frictional effects can be neglected.)

Also, letybe drawn through the points. The regression line and the sample average line are predictors of how y varies when x varies. Note that (y -y) = (y - y\u02c4) + (y\u02c4 -y\u02c4) (see Fig. 1) The explained variation of y is defined as \\sum(y\u02c4 -y)^2 . The unexplained variation is then \\sum(y - y\u02c4)^2 . The coefficient of variation, r^2 is defined as r^2 = (Explained Variation of y) / (Total Variation of y) or, r^2 = {\\sum(y\u02c4 -y)^2} / {\\sum(y -y)^2}(2) The correlation coefficient r is the square root of equation (2).

The op-tical center is the point in the lens through which light can pass without being bent. All rays of light parallel to the principal axis pass through F, the point of principal focus. The distance f between F and the optical center is called the focal length of the lens. It is positive for converging, convex lenses, negative for concave, diverging lenses. Since the person cannot see clearly objects closer than 150 cm, the lens must form a virtual image at that dis-tance. Since the image is formed on the same side of the lens as the object, its distance q from the lens is negative. p = 25 cm q = -150 cm. Substituting in the general equation for lenses, 1/p + 1/q = 1/f (1/25cm) + (1/-150cm) = 1/f f = 30 cm.

{"question": "Explain the events which take place during glycolysis.", "solution": "Glycolysis is the series of matabolic reactions by which glucose is converted to pyruvate, with the concur-rent formation of ATP. Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell, and the presence of oxygen is unnecessary. Glucose is first \"activated,\" or phosphorylated by a high- energy phosphate from ATP (See reaction 1). The product, glucose-6- phosphate, undergoes rearrangement to fructose- 6-phospate, which is subsequently phosphorylated by another ATP to yield fructose-1, 6- diphosphate (reactions 2 and 3). This hexose is then split into two three- carbon sugars, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (also called PGAL) and dihydroxyacetone, phosphate (see reaction 4). Only PGAL can be directly degraded in glycolysis; dihydroxyacetone phosphate is reversibly converted into PGAL by enzyme action (reaction 4a). Since two molecules of PGAL are thus produced per molecule of glucose oxidized, the products of the subsequent reactions can be considered \"doubled\" in amount 1 glucose \\textemdash\\textemdash\\ding{217} 2 PGAL PGAL gets oxidized and phosphorylated. NAD+, the coenzyme in the dehydrogenase enzyme which catalyzed this step, gets reduced to NADH, and 1,3-diphosphoglycerate is formed (reac-tion 5). The energy-rich phosphate at carbon 1 of 1,3 diphosphoglycerate reacts with ADP to form ATP and 3-phospho- glycerate. This undergoes rearrangement to 2- phosphoglycerate, which is subsequently dehydrated, forming an energy- rich phosphate: phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) (reaction 8). Finally, this phosphate group is transferred to ADP, yield-ing ATP and pyruvate, (reaction 9) Since two molecules of PGAL are formed per molecule of glucose, four ATP molecules are produced during glycolysis. The net yield of ATP is only 2, since 2 ATP were utilized in initiating glycolysis (reactions 1 and 3 ). Pyruvate is then converted to acetyl coenzyme A which enters the Krebs cycle. In addition, two molecules of NADH are pro-duced per molecule of glucose. Hence, the net result of glycolysis is that glucose is degraded to pyruvate with the net formation of of 2 ATP and 2 NADH. The process of glycolysis can be summarized as follows: glucose + 2ADP + 2Pi + 2NAD+ \\textemdash\\textemdash> 2 pyruvate + 2ATP + 2NADH + 2H+", "images": ["images/F03-0073_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F03-0073.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Glycolysis is the series of metabolic reactions by which glucose is converted to pyruvate, with the concurrent formation of ATP.

{"question": "Write possible sets of quantum numbers for electrons in the second main energy level.", "solution": "In wave mechanical theory, four quantum numbers are needed to describe the electrons of an atom. The first or principal quantum number, n, designates the main energy level of the electron and has integral values of 1, 2, 3, ... . The second quantum number, l, designates the energy sublevel within the main energy level. The values of l depend upon the value of n and range from zero to n - 1. The third quantum number,m_l, designates the particular orbital within the energy sublevel. The number of orbitals of a given kind per energy sublevel is equal to the number ofm_l values (2l + 1) . The quantum numberm_lcan have any integral value from + l to - l including zero. The fourth quantum number, s, describes the two ways in which an electron may be aligned with a magnetic field (+ 1/2 or - 1/2). The states of the electrons within atoms are described by four quantum numbers, n, l,m_l, s. Another important factor is the Pauli exclusion principle which states that no two electrons within the same atom may have the same four quantum numbers. To solve this problem one must use the principles of assigning electrons to theirorbitals. If n = 2; l can then have the values 0, 1;m_lcan have the values of + 1, 0 or - 1, and s is always + 1/2 or - 1/2.

{"question": "Starting from rest at the top, a small sphere rolls without slipping off a large fixed sphere. At what point will the small sphere leave the surface of the big sphere? (See figure).", "solution": "The small sphere will leave the surface of the large sphere when the normal force (N^\\ding{217}) of the latter on the former is zero, for this means that contact has ceased. Applying Newton's Second Law to the tangential and radial components of motion of the small sphere (see figure), we obtain F_radtal = Ma_radial = Mg cos \\varphi - N F_tangential = Ma_tangential = mg sin \\varphi where a_radial is positive in the direction of BA^\\ding{217}, and a_tangential is positive in the direction of motion of the sphere.

In order to find it, we may use the principle of conservation of energy to relate the energy of the small sphere at points O and S. Since the sphere starts from rest at O, it has only potential energy. Measuring poten-tial energy from A, the energy at O is E = Mg(R + r)(2) At S, the sphere has potential and kinetic energy equal in amount to the energy at O.

{"question": "In what ways are studies of twins useful insupplying information about the relative importance of inheritance and environment in the determination of a given trait?", "solution": "Although both environment and heredity are involved in the development of any trait, a change in some aspect of the environment may alter one character relative-ly little as compared to its effect on another character. An individual's blood type, for example, seems fairly impervious to practically all environmental effects, while the phenotype of a diabetic can be radically changed by a mere alteration in diet. Moreover, not all characters are determined by simple genetic effects which have easily observable relationships with simple environmental changes. Some traits , such as intelligence in animals, are probably determined by complex genetic-environmental interactions, the results of which are then viewed as a single trait. Performing studies using twins is one way of deter-mining the relative contributions of genetic composition and environment to the expression of a given trait. There are two kinds of twins: identical or monozygotic twins, which arise from a single fertilized egg, and fraternal ordizygotictwins, which result from the fertilization of two separate eggs. From this definition, we can see that monozygotic twins are genetically the same in every respect, while dizygotictwins may differ genetically for any character. By comparing both kinds of twins with regard to a particular trait, we can evaluate the roles of environment and heredity on the development of that character . On the one hand, we have genetically identical individuals of the same age and sex, raised in a single uterine environment?andon the other , we have genetically dissimilar individuals of the same age, though not necessarily of the same sex, raised in a common uterine environment. Presumably the difference between these two kinds of twins is only in the extent of their genetic similarity. Using twins for genetic studies, then, provides built-in controls for both the effect of environment and the effect of heredity on the expression of a given trait. For example, if phenotypic similarities for a particular character are greater among identical twins than among fraternal twins, we can ascribe this to the genetic similarity of the identical pair and the genetic dissimi-larity of the fraternal pair. On the other hand, if both identical and fraternal pairs show the same extent of phenotypic differences for a particular character, we can assume that genetic similarity or dissimilarity plays less of a role than the differences which may occur in the post-uterine environment of the twins. As a concrete illustration of this, consider a pair of monozygotic twins reared in different postnatal environments and a pair ofdizygotictwins reared in a common postnatal environment. If the monozygotic twins were found to exhibit a wide range of dissimilarities and thedizygotictwins a significant range of similarities , the importance of the environment as a phenotypic modifier of the genetic composition of an individual can readily be appreciated.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F26-0684.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Performing studies using twins is one way of determining the relative contributions of genetic composition and environment to the expression of a given trait."}
{"question": "Two electrolytic cells were placed in series. One was composed of AgNO_3 and the other of CuSO_4,. Electricity was passed through the cells until 1.273g of Ag had been deposited. How much copper was deposited at the same time?", "solution": "To find out how much copper was deposited, you need to know how many faradays were contained in the electricity that passed through the solution. One faraday, be definition, deposits one gram-equivalent of material. The equivalent weight of a substance is that amount of the substance which 1 mole of electrons (1 faraday) can oxidize or reduce to a neutral species. You are told that 1.273g of Ag are deposited. From this, you can compute the number of faradays. The oxidation state of Ag is +1. Thus, the reaction that deposited Ag had to be (Ag^+) + (e^-)\\rightarrow Ag . Thus,1 mole of electrons yields 1 gram-equivalent weight of Ag . In this case, the gram-equivalent weight equals the atomic weight, since 1 mole of Ag is produced with 1 mole of electrons. Recalling the definition of a faraday, you can say that 1 faraday can deposit 107.87g of Ag (the atomic weight). You are told, however, that only 1.273g has been deposited. Thus, the following proportion can be used to find the number of faradays used: (1.273g Ag) / (X Faradays) = (107.87g Ag) / (1 Faraday) Solving, X = .01180 Faradays. Thus, the amount of faradays passed is .01180F, which means the amount of copper deposited depends on this amount of electricity. To deposit copper, you must perform the reaction Cu^2+ + 2e^- \\rightarrow Cu you see that it takes 2 moles of electrons to deposit one mole of copper. Thus, one faraday can only deposit one half of a mole copper. Thus, 1 faraday reduces (1 / 2)(63.54) = 31.77 grams. You have, however, only .01180 faradays.

{"question": "Describe the functional units of a typical computer system hardware.", "solution": "The computer hardware typically consists of functional units shown in Figure 1-3. Take as an example the lower end of the various types of computer systems (see next problem), such as Apple Mac IIx, IBM PS/2 80, and Next Inc. NeXT systems. In such systems, the input device is typically a monitor (a console terminal usually ca-pable of graphics) and optionally another CRT terminal. Strictly speaking, these devices are used for both input and output, where the keyboard is used for input and the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) screen is used for output. In the example, typically the keyboard is type PC with a number of functions keys for the monitor used as the main system console. Additional terminals that are attached to the RS-232C serial ports of the personal computer may be of plain ASCII type capable of displaying only characters or graphics type capable of low or high resolution graphics. As noted, the user's screen is the output device. The output device may also be a printer attached to either parallel ports (Centronix type with 36 pins) or serial ports (RS-232C type with 25 pins) . The printer normally prints on a standard 8.5 \u00d7 11 paper with number of characters per line de-termined by the letter font used. The printers may be of letter- quality or dot-matrix type. The former normally uses daisy-chain character fonts and ribbons much like the typewriters. The dot--matrix printers define characters on a matrix of dots (normally, 5- by-7 or 9-by-12). These, in turn, may be of ribbon or ink-jet types. The ribbon types imprint the pattern through a ribbon, whereas ink-jet types eject special ink through the pattern. Finally, there are laser printers that utilize toners (ink pow-ders) and laser technology to produce high quality print indis-tinguishable from letter quality. The dot-matrix printers are capable of picture output in graphics mode. The communication device is generally a modem that converts signals back and forth for transmission over public telephone lines. The modem may be built-in (e.g. an electronic card inside the PC) or external such as Hayes smartmodem series. The disk may consist of one or two diskette drivers capable of processing 4.5-inch diskettes with capacities of 340 kilo-bytes or 1.2 megabytes. There may also be an optional internal Hard Disk Unit (HDU) with capacities anywhere from 10 to 300 megabytes. In the case of the more modern NeXT personal com-puter, an optical (rather than magnetic) disk unit with 500 megabyte capacity is used, along with an optional magnetic car-tridge tape unit, is used. Note that, in a way analogous to the purchase of automobiles, the computers come with standard (e.g. bundled with basic price) features and accessories, and also optional features and accessories (at additional cost!). The primary memory is Random Access Memory (RAM) that can be read or written. There may, in addition, be ROM memories that contain read-only code to be executed. Such memories may contain frequently used input-output or communication software that is burned (stored permanently) into the ROM. As we move from personal to the more sophisticated computer systems that can support many users, the picture is more complex in terms of a bewildering variety of input, output, and communi-cation devices.

{"question": "What is the meaning and significance of the Pauling electronegativity scale?", "solution": "In any chemical bond, electrons are shared between the bonding atoms. In covalent bonds, the valence electrons are shared almost equally - the shared electrons spend about the same amount of time with each atom. In ionic bonds, the valence electrons are monopolized by one atom. The degree to which a bond will be ionic or covalent is dependent upon the relative electron-attracting ability of the bonding atoms. The Paulingelectronegativityscale provides a measure for the relative electron-attracting abilities orelectronegativityof each element. The most electronegative element, fluorine, is assigned the highest number, 4.0. The least electron attracting elements (and consequently, those most willing to lose electrons), cesium and francium, are assigned the lowest number, 0.7. Numbers are assigned to the remaining elements so that no element has a higher number than an element more electronegative than it. Furthermore, the numbers are assigned so that the differ-ences between theelectronegativitiesof two elements is indicative of the ionic quality of the bond that forms between them. In particular, if the difference is 1.7 or greater, then the shared electrons are monopolized by the more electronegative atom to such a great extent that the bond is said to be ionic. If the difference is less than 1.7, the bond is covalent.

Axon regeneration is believed to involve theneurilemma, a cellular sheath composed of Schwann cells which envelopes the axon. The role the neurilemmasheath plays in regeneration is to provide a channel for the axon to grow back to its former position. What happens is that the growing axon enters the old sheath tube and proceeds along it to its final destination in the central nervous system or periphery. In some experiments, theneurilemmasheath is removed and replaced by a conduit, for example, a section of blood vessel or extremely fine plastic tube.

At time t + \u2206t the mass of the rocket is m + \u2206m where \u2206m is negative since the total mass of the vehicle is de-creasing, while the velocity is v + \u2206v and the momentum is (m + \u2206m) (v + \u2206v). However, after time \u2206t, since \u2206m in mass leaves the rocket, it introduces its own momentum. In the inertial frame of reference, the velocity of the fuel is v - u which is the velocity of the rocket minus the velocity of the fuel with respect to the rocket. The mass of the fuel ejected during time \u2206t is \u2206m, and so its momentum is \u2206m(v - u).

{"question": "Most cells fall within the range of 5-20 microns. What factors keep the size of the cell within these boun-daries?", "solution": "Normally, a cell cannot attain a size greater than 20 microns due to the limits imposed by the size inter-relationships of its components. For example, there is a relationship between the amount of nuclear material and the size of the cell; this limits cells to a size where there is an optimal proportion of nuclear material to the rest of the cell. A cell can have only as much material as its number of genes can handle. And since the nucleus controls the entire cell, there is a limit to how far away parts can be located from the nucleus. However, some larger cells have solved these problems by having more than one nucleus. Because materials must be transported throughout the cell and among the organelles, the relationship between the amount of cytoplasm and the amount of cellular organelles is also important in limiting cell size. If there is too much cytoplasm, transportation and communication between various areas of the cell would not be efficient. This transport problem is slightly minimized by processes such as cytoplasmic streaming. The effect of the amount of membrane surface area as compared to cell volume is the most important factor in limiting cell size. The intake of nutrients, the exchange of gases, and the excretion of wastes are all dependent on the surface area available for diffusion of these materials. How this is affected by increases in cell size can be seen through the following mathematical relationships: volume (sphere) = (4/3)\\pir^3 (r = radius) surface area = 4\\pir^2 proportionally: (volume / surface area) = [{(4/3)\\pir^3 } / {4\\pir^2}] = (1/3) r. It can be seen that the volume of the cell increases with the cube of the radius while the surface area in-creases only with the square of the radius. In other words, the surface area increases at a rate 1/3 r slower than the volume. Thus, if a cell's size increases, its surface-area may not increase proportionally enough to satisfy the needs of the larger cell. There is also a limit as to how small a cell can be. The minimum size can be predicted by determining how many macromolecules a cell must have in order for it to keep up its metabolism. Mathematical analysis of the cellular content of the PPL organism (the smallest known single- celled organism) will supply the answer. It is estimated that there are 1600 macromolecules (nucleic acids, proteins, etc.) in the PPL organism. Assuming that the cell must perform approximately 500 reactions in order to survive, we can determine that (1600 macromolecules / 500 reactions) are required on the average, or 3 to 4 macromolecules are required for each reaction. Taking into account the average size of the macromolecules necessary, the minimum size that any cell could be can be approximated.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F02-0034.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The size of a cell is limited by the size inter-relationships of its components, the amount of nuclear material, the distance of parts from the nucleus, the amount of cytoplasm, the amount of cellular organelles, and the amount of membrane surface area compared to cell volume."}
{"question": "Estimate the minimum voltage needed to excite K radiation from an x-ray tube with a tungsten target, and calculate the wavelength of the K_\\alpha line.", "solution": "Moseley found experimentally that the x-ray line spectrum varies in a regular way from element to element, unlike the irregular variations of optical spectra. This regular variation occurs because characteristic x-rays are due to transitions involving the innermost electrons of the atom. Because of the shielding of the other elec-trons the inner electron energies do not depend on the com-plex interactions of the outer electrons, which are respon-sible for the complicated optical spectra. Also, the inner electrons are shielded from the interatomic forces respon-sible for the binding of the atoms in solids, According to the Bohr model of the atom, the energy of an electron in the first orbit is proportional to the square of the nuc-lear charge. Mosely therefore, reasoned that the energy, and thus the frequency, of a characteristic x-ray photon should vary as the square of the atomic number of the element. He plotted the square root of the frequency of particular x-ray lines versus the atomic number Z of theelement. He found that his curves could be described by the general equation, equation, f = A^2 (Z - b)^2 f = A^2 (Z - b)^2 Where f is the frequency of the x-ray and A and b are constants for each line. One family of lines, called the K-series, has b = 1. If the bombarding electron in an x-ray tube knocks an electron from the n = 1 inner orbit of a target atom out of the atom, photons are emitted corres-ponding to transitions of other electrons to the vacancy in the n = 1 orbit. The lowest frequency line corresponds to the lowest energy transition, from n = 2 to n = 1. This line is called the K_\\alpha line. Bohr's relation for the frequency of a photon emitted from a one electron atom is, f = Z^2 [(2\\pi^2m e^4) / {(4\\piE_0)^2 h^3}] [{1/(n_2^2)} - {1/(n_1^2)}](2) The energy E of a photon is given by hf. Using Z - 1 in place of Z in eq (2) so as to fit the form of Moseley's equation (1) for the K-series, we find, E = hf = [(2\\pi^2m e^4) / {(4\\piE_0)^2 h^2}] [{1/(n_2^2)} - {1/(n_1^2)}](z - 1)^2(3) For K radiation to occur, an electron must be knocked from the n_1 = 1 orbit to infinity (n_2 = \\infty). This is the minimum energy that must be transmitted to the atom for K radiation and is, E_ionization = [(2\\pi^2me^4) / {(4\\piE_0)^2 h^2}] (Z - 1)^2 [(1/\\infty) - 1] = 2.18 \u00d7 10^-18 (Z - 1)^2joules = 13.6 ev (Z - 1)^2 For tungsten, Z = 74, and the energy input required is (13.6 ev) (73)^2 = 72,800 ev.

{"question": "Discuss the etiology, epidemiology and prophylaxis of tuberculosis .", "solution": "It is first necessary to define the terms used in the question before one can answer it. Etiology refers to the cause of a disease. Epidemiology deals with the cause and control of epidemics. An epidemic is the unusual prevalence or sudden appearance of a disease in a community. Prophylaxis is the preventive treatment used to protect against disease. Many of the important infections of man are air-borne and cause diseases of the respiratory tract. Tuberculosis is an endemic respiratory disease ; it is peculiar to a locality or a people. Although evidence of itsexistence has been found in Egyptian mummies 3000 years old, it is still a leadingcause of death. In the nineteenth century, Robert Koch isolated the causative agent of human tuberculosis -Mycobacteriumtuberculosis. Koch proved that pure cultures of these bacilli would produce the infection in experimental animals, and he later recovered the bacilli form these animals . There are several types of tubercle bacilli (the common name): the human, bovine, avian and other varieties. One strain is almost exclusively a human parasite, and is responsible for over ninety percent of all cases of tuberculosis. The less common bovine strain can cause tuberculosis in man through ingestion of in-fected beef or milk from an infected cow. It is characteristic of tuberculosis and other res-piratory diseases to occur in epidemic form, attacking many people within a short time. Their incidence usually increases during fall and winter, when many people frequently remain indoors. The tubercle bacillus is transmitted by association with infected people through the secretions of the nose and throat, which is spread in droplets by coughing and sneezing. It may be transmitted by articles which have been used by an infected person, such as eating and drink-ing utensils and handkerchiefs. The lungs are the most commonly affected tissue , often exhibiting tubercles or small nodules. These are areas of destroyed lung tissue in which the tubercle bacilli grow. Symptoms of tuber-culosis include pleurisy (inflamationof the pleural mem-brane which line the chest and cover the lungs), chest pains, coughing, fatigue and loss of weight. Treatment consists of bed rest, nourishing diet, and sometimes chemotherapy. The most effective drug, INH (isonicotinicacid hydrazide ) is used both for chemotherapy andchemopropylaxis. For actual prevention, the drug is administered before infection to highly susceptible individuals. High death rates in developing countries are due to substandard housing , overcrowding, and malnutrition. Prophylaxis for a community is best achieved when living and working conditions are not overcrowded, diet is ade-quate, and proper sanitation is available.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F05-0159.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Tuberculosis is an endemic respiratory disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

{"question": "Explain what difficulties would arise if messenger RNA molecules were not destroyed after they had produced some polypeptide chains.", "solution": "Upon translation, mRNA molecules give rise to polypeptide chains. Normally, mRNA molecules are short- lived and are broken down by RNAase after a few transla-tions, thereby allowing a cell to control its metabolic activity. If an mRNA molecule were not destroyed, it would continue to synthesize its protein, and soon there would be an excess of this protein in the cell. This condition leads to some important implications for the cell. The continual translation of mRNA into proteins would entail a serious depletion of the energy store in the cell. For example, before an amino acid can attach to a tRNA molecule, it has to be activated. Activation is brought about by the hydrolysis of one molecule of ATP. So for each amino acid in the polypeptide chain, one molecule of ATP must be used. If translation were to proceed ceaselessly because the mRNA is not destroyed, large amounts of ATP molecules would be consumed and the energy supply in the cell depleted. In addition, the cell would accumulate proteins that it may not need. This use of large amounts of energy to produce unneeded protein would be a wasteful process. Indeed, excessive accumulation of a protein may even be harmful to the cell or organism. For example, given the right environ-ment, a protease such as pepsin, if present in more than sufficient amounts, will eat away the wall of the stomach, forming an ulcer.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F24-0629.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "If mRNA molecules were not destroyed, they would continue to synthesize proteins leading to an excess of proteins in the cell, serious depletion of the energy store, and potential harm to the cell or organism."}
{"question": "The following bases, and their conjugate acids (as the chlorides), are available in the lab: ammonia, NH_3; pyridine, C_5H_5N; ethylamine, CH_3CH_2NH_2. A buffer solution of pH 9 is to be prepared, and the total concentration of buffering reagents is to be 0.5 mole/liter, (a) Choose the best acid- base pair, (b) Give the recipe for preparing one liter of the solution, (c) Calculate the pH of the solution after 0.02 mole ofNaOHhas been added per liter.", "solution": "This problem deals with the preparation of a buffer solution and then to show the effect the addition of a base has on thepH. If this is a truly buffered system, then, the pH should be only slightly altered when a small quantity of base is added. Since we are using bases it will be more convenient to work initially withpOH. pH is converted topOHby the equation: 14 = pH +pOHorpOH= 14 -pH. Substituting the given value of pH,pOH= 14 - 9 = 5. In part (a) one is asked to choose the strongest base. At a given pOH, the strongest base haspOHabout equal topK_b(the pH at which dissociation occurs). The maximum buffering capacity and minimum sensitivity to pH change occurs when the concentrations of the acid and base are initially equal. From a table ofpK_bvalues, it is found that pK_NH3 = 4.75, pK_C5H5N = 8.81, and pK_CH3CH2NH2 = 3.3 Therefore, NH_3 has apK_b closest to 5, which means it is the best base. To prepare a one liter solution, as requested in part (b) , find the initial concentrations of the components to be added and their ratio. NH_3 is the base and NH_4Cl dissociates to the acid NH_4^+ . The reaction equation is NH_3 + H_2O \\rightleftarrows NH_4^+ + OH^- K_b = 1.76 \u00d7 10^-5. To find the ratio, set up the equilibrium constant equation: K_b = {[NH_4^+][OH^-]} / [NH_3] = 1.76 \u00d7 10^-5. Rewriting to obtain the ratio, one has: [NH_4^+] / [NH_3] = {Kb/ [OH^-] = [(1.76 \u00d7 10^-5) / (1.0 \u00d7 10^-5)] = 1.76 . ([OH^-] = 1 \u00d7 10^-5,sincepOH= 5 andpOH= - log [OH^-].) Therefore, NH_4Cl and NH_3 should be added in the molar ratio of 1.76 : 1. Since it is given that the sum of the concentrations of the buffering reagents equals 0.5 mole/liter, the following equation can be written which says, in effect, that the sum of the parts is equal to the whole [NH_3] + [NH_4^+ ] = 0.5. Let [NH_3] = x and since the ratio is 1.76 : 1, let [NH_4^+] = 1.76 x. This results in x + 1.76 x = 0.5 x = [NH_3] = 0.18 mole/liter 1.76 x = [NH_4^+ ] = 0.32 mole/liter. Therefore, to prepare a 1 liter solution, mix 0.18 moles NH_3 and 0.32 moles NH_4Cl and then add H_2O until a total volume of 1 liter is obtained. Part (c) tells one to add 0.02 MNaOH. Since it is a strong base, complete dissociation occurs giving 0.02 mole Na^+ and 0.02 mole OH^-. The base OH^- then reacts fully with the acid NH_4^+ and converts 0.02 mole NH_4^+ to NH_3. This is more clearly seen below. NH_4^+ + H_2O \\rightleftarrows NH_3 + OH^- Before:0.32 mole0.18 mole After:0.32 - 0.02 = 0.30 mole0.18 + 0.02 = 0.20 mole Substituting these new values into the equilibrium constant equation, one arrives at [OH^-] and thenpH.One then has K_b = {[NH_3][OH^-]} / [NH_4^+] . Substituting, [OH^-] = {K_b[NH_4^+]} / [ NH_3] = [{1.76 \u00d7 10^-5 (0.20)}/(0.30)] = 1.17 \u00d7 10^-5 mole/liter. Thus,pOH= - log [OH^-] = - log [1.17 \u00d7 10^-5] = 4.93.

{"question": "Describe the operations and built-in functions used for char-acterstring manipulations.", "solution": "One of the most useful operations on character strings is called concatenation. Concatenation is used to join two characterstring operands, giving a single character string as a result. For example, 'JANEb' \\vert\\vert 'FONDA' = 'JANEbFONDA' The concatenation operator must connect the character string JANEbwith the character string FONDA. The stringJANEbFONDAwill result. The concatenation operator is represented by \\vert\\vert. The string resulting from the execution of a concatenation oper-ation has a length equal to sum of the lengths of the two operands (character strings). To understand the processing of variable length and fixed length string data, consider the following example. DECLARE[(FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME) CHAR(10), STUDENT_NAME CHAR(15)] VARYING; GET LIST(FIRST_NAME, LAST.NAME); STUDENT_NAME = FIRST_NAME \\vert\\vertb\\vert\\vert LAST_NAME; If on the data card we have 'JANE', 'FONDA' thentheGET statement creates the followings VariableValueCurrent length FIRST_NAMEJANE4 LAST_NAMEFONDA5 but due to the varying attribute, no blanks are added, and STUDENT_NAME =JANEbFONDA butif the varying attribute is not specified thentheGET statement creates thefollowing: VariableValueCurrent length FIRST_NAMEJANEbbbbbb10 LAST_NAMEFONDAbbbbbb10 Hence STUDENT_NAME =JANEbbbbbbFONDAbbbbbb. It has a length of21 characters. But the declared length is 15 so the last 6 characters will betruncated, and hence the following is obtained: STUDENT_NAME =JANEbbbbbbFOND Condition Testing and comparison Operations: All eight comparison operators (>,>=,= ,<=,<,\\lnot>,\\textquotedblleft\\lnot= ,\\lnot<) , together withthe condition-testing IF statement can be used with character type operands. Comparison can only be made with character strings of the same length. If the operands are of different lengths, the shorter character string valueis expanded at the right with blank characters. If two character stringsof length zero (i.e., null strings) are compared, the result of the '=' comparisonis true. All other comparison operators re-turn a false when appliedto two null-string operands. Character strings of more than one characterare compared, character by character, in a left-to-right order. STRING BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS: For string manipulations, three built-in functions are provided in PL/I. 1) LENGTH built-in function 2) SUBSTR built-in function 3) INDEX built-in function LENGTH Built-in function:The length of character string variables declaredwith varying attributes may change during the execution of the PL/Iprogrma.It may be necessary to utilize the current length of a characterstring during cal-culations . The built-in function 'LENGTH' returns an integer value which is the currentlength of the character string. e.g.STUDENT_NAME = 'JERRY' N = LENGTH (STUDENT_NAME); LENGTH returns a value of 5 as the length of the character string. The SUBSTR Built-in function:The substring function extracts a segmentof a string (i.e. a substring) from a given character string. The functionreference uses three arguments. e.g.TAR = SUBSTR (CHAR-STRING,i, j) 1. The first argument CHAR-STRING identifies thechar-acterstring fromwhich the selection process is to take place. 2. The second argument 'i' identifies the starting position in the characterstring from where extraction of the substring is to be done. It isalways an integer value. If k is the current length of a character string, then, 0 <i\\leq k. 3. The third argument ' j ' specifies the length of the substring extracted.' j' is also always an integer. If the value of j is zero, the substringbuilt-in function returns a null string. It is not necessary that this argument, viz., ' j ' always be specified explicitly. e.g.STUDENT_NAME = 'TOMbANUTH'. LAST_NAME =SUBSTR(STUDENT_NAME,5,3) Then from the character string STUDENT_NAME a substring has to beextracted and assigned to the variable LAST_NAME. Herei=5 which indicatesthat the substring begins from the 5th position i.e. A. Also, j=3 whichgives the length of the substring to be extracted. Hence LAST_NAME = ANU. If j was not specified e.g.LAST_NAME =SUBSTR(STUDENT_NAME,5). thenthe substring returned starts from the 5th place, and extends up to theend of the character-string. Thus, LAST_NAME = ANUTH. The substring built-in function may also appear on the left-hand sideof the assignment operator (=) . In these cases, the built-in function is usedas a pseudo-variable. The purpose is to replace a part of a character stringitem with a new value. For example, consider the following: STUDENT_NAME = 'JAMESbCOOK' SUBSTR(STUDENT_NAME,1,5) = 'HARRY' producesa new value for the variable STUDENT_NAME. Thus, STUDENT_NAME =HARRYbCOOK. The INDEX Built-in function: The INDEX built-in func-tion tests a givencharacter string value for the occurrence of a specific substring, and returnsan integer value. The search is performed from left-to-right and the integervalue returned specifies the leftmost position in the first sub-string matched. If no match is found, the value zero isre-turned . e.g.STUDENT_NAME = 'TOMbPETERSON' K =INDEX[STUDENT_NAME,'b'] A search forbis made and an integer value of 4 is returned because ab b b appearsin the 4th position in the character String 'TOMbPETERSON' . Thus, K = 4.

{"question": "Plant tissues that are neither considered surface tissues nor vascular tissues, are referred to as fundamental tissue. Describe the various types of fundamental tissues.", "solution": "Fundamental tissues make up most of the plant body. Examples include the soft parts of the leaf, the pith (central core of stems and roots), the cortex (outer area of stems and roots), and the soft parts of flowers and fruits. The chief functions of the fundamental tissues are the production and storage of food. Some fundamental tissues may also function in physical support of the plant body. There are four types of fundamental tissues, each composed of a single type of cell. One type is parenchyma tissue, which occurs in roots, stems and leaves. Parenchyma consists of small cells with a thin cell wall and a thin layer of cytoplasm surrounding a large vacuole. The cells are loosely packed, resulting in abundant spaces in the tissue for gas and nutrient exchange. Most of the chloroplasts of leaves are found in these cells. A second type is collenchyma tissue. It contains cells that are generally more elongate and their cell walls are irregularly thickened compared to the cell walls of parenchyma. The corners of their cell walls are thickened to provide the plant with support. These tissues occur just beneath the epidermis of stems and leaf stalks. Sclerenchyma tissue, a third type, also functions in support. Most mature cells of this tissue are dead. They have very thick cells walls to provide support and mechanical strength. The cell wall is usually impregnated with an additional tough substance called lignin. The cell wall may be so thick that the internal space of the cell is nearly obliterated. Sclerenchyma is found in many stems and roots. Sclerenchyma cells are divided into two cate-gories, fibers and sclereids. Fibers are elongate cells with tapered ends. Fiber cells are tough and strong, but flexible. Sclereids are more irregularly shaped cells. Stone cells are rounded sclereids. They- are found in the hard shells of nuts and in seeds. Endodermis, the fourth type of fundamental tissue, occurs in a layer surrounding the vascular core of roots. Endodermal cells have cell walls thickened with lignin and suberin which are chemical substances that make the cells waterproof. The endodermal layer is one cell thick, and the cells are compactly arranged. This cell layer is called the Casparian strip. The Casparian strip regulates the entry of water into the vascular tissues of roots.", "images": ["images/F02-0055_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F02-0055.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The four types of fundamental tissues are parenchyma tissue, collenchyma tissue, sclerenchyma tissue, and endodermis."}
{"question": "What evidence supports the theory that vascular plants evolved directly from green algae, and not from bryophytes?", "solution": "At one time it was believed that the vascular plants evolved from a less advanced bryophyte, such as the liverworts or hornworts. But although there is fossil evidence of true vascular plants in the Silurian period some 360 million years ago, the first evidence of the bryophytes does not appear until the Pennsylvanian period, which began about 100 million years later. The fact that the bryophytes first appear in a later period than the vascular plants makes it unlikely that the vascular plants could have evolved from bryophytes. Since green algae contain pigments (chlorophylls), principal food reserves (starch) similar to those of the higher plants, and since fossil evidence shows they invaded the land some 140 million years earlier than the first group of vascular plants, botanists are now inclined to believe that ancient green algae were the common ancestors of both higher nonvascular and vascular plants.

This means that the number of moles of H_2 O_2 must be determined, since you already know the volume. To determine the number of moles of H_2 O_2, you know that, when oxidized, 1 mole of H_2 O_2 yields 1 mole of O_2. Thus, if you know the number of moles of O_2 produced, you also know the moles of H_2 O_2 originally present. To find the number of moles of O_2, you must use the equation of state.

Find (a) the initial concentration of AB, (b) the A_2 and B_2 concentrations at equilibrium and (c) the partial pressures of A_2 and B_2 and AB at equilibrium.", "solution": "Use the equation of state, which indicates PV = NRT, where P = pressure, V = volume, N = moles, R= universal gas constant (.0821 liter- atm/mole-K), and T = temperature in degreeskelvin(Celsius plus 273\\textdegree). You can use this equation to find N, the moles of AB initially present. (a) PV = NRT or N = PV/RT = {(25) (5)} / {(.0821) (300)} = 5.08 moles. Thus, the initial concentration = moles/liters = 5.08/5 = 1.02. (b) K = 50 (given).By definition, K = ( [AB]^2 / { [A_2 ] [B_2 ]}). At equilibrium, let x = moles/liter of AB that are dissociated. If its initial con-centration is 1.02M, then the concentration is (1.02-x)M at equilibrium. From the reaction, 1 mole each of A_2 and B_2 is produced by every 2 moles of AB which react. Thus, if x moles/liter of AB dissociate, (1/2) x moles/liter of both A_2 and B_2 are produced.Recalling,K= ([AB]^2 / {[A_2] [B_2]}) = 50, you now substitute to obtain (1.02-x)^2 / (.5x)^2 = 50 .

Furthermore, the net force on the bottom surface of the tank is due only to the weight of the water above this surface. Hence, F_net = Mg(1) where M is the mass of fluid in the tank.

If all of the sulfur is converted to BaSO_4, what is the percentage of sulfur in the tomato?", "solution": "The percentage of sulfur in the tomato is the weight of sulfur in the tomato divided by the total weight of the tomato multiplied by a factor of 100. To find the percentage, the weight of sulfur must be calculated. This is done by calculating the amount of sulfur precipitated out or, in other words, the amount of sulfur present in 0.466 g of BaSO_4. Using the Law of Definite Proportions, 32 g (1mole) of sulfur are consumed to form 233 g (1mole) of BaSO_4. Thus, once the percentage by weight of S in BaSO_4, is determined, then the weight of sulfur can be calculated. The fraction of S in BaSO_4 is [MW of S / MW of BaSO_4]= [(32 g / mole) / (233 g / mole)] = 0.14 The weight of sulfur in 0.466 g of BaSO_4 is thus, (0.14) (0.466 g)= 0.065 a.

{"question": "Ecologists refer to the ocean as the marine ecosystem. How are the major marine communities classified and where are the regions of their habitation?", "solution": "The ocean is a very complex ecosystem with many different kinds of communities. Temperature, salinity, availability of light, and depth all affect the nature of these communities and present major barriers to the free movement of organisms that have specific adaptability to certain environmental conditions. The major currents, which keep the waters of the ocean in continous circulation, also affect the nature of marine communities, as do waves and tides. Another important phenomenon, called upwelling, occurs where the winds move surface waters away from the steep coastal slopes, bringing cold water to the surface from the depths which is rich in such nutrients as phosphates and nitrates; the regions of such upswellings are often among the most productive regions of the ocean. The major marine habitats are shown in the accom-panying diagram. Marine organisms in general are divided into two groups, depending upon whether they live in the open water or upon or beneath the bottom. Those organisms that live suspended or swimming in the open waters are said to be pelagic. Bottom dwellers, called benthic organisms, may live on the surface or beneath the surface of the ocean floor. The benthic organisms include both attached organisms and those organisms that move in or on the substratum. Bottom dwellers are generally distinct for each of the neritic, or coastal, regions and the type found in each region is largely dependent on the type of ocean floor, whether it is sand, rock, or mud. Many animals are adapted for living in the sand and this group includes representatives of virtually every phylum of animals. Pelagic organisms are of two types. The microscopic plants and animals that are unable to move against the current are collectively called the plankton. The larger, free swimming animals that are able to move at will are called nekton. The planktonic plants constitute the phytoplankton. The phytoplanktonic algae are the most important producers throughout the ocean. The phytoplank-ton are eaten by a great array of invertebrate animals, ranging in size from protozoans to large medusae. These latter are the primary consumers. These, in turn, are consumed by other, larger invertebrates and vertebrates. As would be expected, plankton attains its greatest density in the upper lighted zone where there is sufficient light for photosynthesis to occur. In productive waters, planktonic organisms may occur in such enormous numbers that the water appears turbid. The animals that are permanent inhabitants of the lower dark zones are carnivorous, suspension, or detritus (dead organic matter) feeders and depend ultimately on the photosynthetic activity of the microscopic algae in the upper, lighted regions. Therefore, vertical distribution of marine organisms is largely controlled by the depths of light penetration. Light sufficient for photosynthesis to exceed respiration penetrates only a short distance below the surface, with this distance being dependent upon the turbidity of the water. Below this is a region where some photosynthesis can occur, but here the production of organic matter is less than the loss through respiration.", "images": ["images/F30-0787_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F30-0787.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": true, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Marine organisms are divided into pelagic and benthic organisms.

{"question": "In a chemical reaction requiring two atoms of phosphorus for five atoms of oxygen, how many grams of oxygen are required by 3.10 g of phosphorus?", "solution": "Because the relationship between the phosphorus and oxygen is given in atoms, the relationship also holds for moles.

{"question": "We know that radiation and chemicals can cause cancer. Can viruses be a cause of cancer?", "solution": "Cancer involves an abnormality in the control of cell division and cell function. Cancer cells usually produce cell masses called tumors. These cells lack the normal control systems that shut off unwanted cell division . The factors which give cancer cells their characteristic property of unregulated growth are passed on from parent to progeny cancer cells. For this reason, it has been suggested that genetic changes occur within chromosomal DNA. These changes lead to a heritable cancer phenotype. Somatic mutations (mutations in cells that are not destined to become gametes ) may cause a cancer, if the mutation upsets a normal device controlling cell regulation. Some indication that somatic mutations can induce cancer comes from the fact that manycarcinpgens(agents that cause cancer) are also strong mutagens (agents that cause mutations.) Ultraviolet and ionizing forms of radiation are powerful carcinogens and are also highly mutagenic. Exposure of skin to ultraviolet light frequently results in skin cancer, and x-rays applied to the thyroid are associated with increased incidence of thyroidcancer.Manychemicals are also highly carcinogenic and mutagenic . For example, nitrites and nitrates by themselves cause no genetic or carcinogenic changes, but in cells they may become converted to powerful carcinogens- the nitrosamines. Nitrosamines are also known to be mutagens. Nitrates and nitrites are found in cured meats (frankfurters, bacon, ham) and are used to inhibit growth of anaerobic bacteria . In contrast to the somatic mutation proposal is the hypothesis that most cancers are induced by viruses. Viruses which produce tumors in animals are calledonco-genicviruses. While somatic mutations are suspected to cause a loss of functional genetic material, viruses are vehicles into a cell: they introduce new genetic material that may transform the cell into a cancerous type. In addition to multiplying and lysing their host cell, certain viruses can insert their chromosomes into the host chromosome. In some animal species, this process can transform the cell into a morphologically distinguishable cancer cell. At this point, the virus is in theprophagestate. Therefore, absence of detectable viruses does not provide ample evidence for or against a viral cause of a cancer. In 1911, an RNA virus, called the Rous sarcoma virus, was shown to be the causal agent of a sarcoma (a tumor of connective tissue) in chickens . Other RNA viruses cause sarcomas andleukemias (uncontrolledproliferation of leucocytes) in both birds and mammals. One group of DNA viruses causes warts on the skin of mammals. Other DNA tumor viruses is a mouse virus calledpolyomaand a monkey virus called SV 40.

{"question": "Why is the phenomenon of diffusion important tomovement ofmaterials in living cells?", "solution": "In a living cell, chemical reactions are con-stantly taking place to producethe energy or organic com-pounds needed to maintain life. The reactingmaterials of chemical reactions must be supplied continuously to theactively metabolizing cell, and the products distributed to other parts of thecell where they are needed or lower in concentration. This is extremely importantbecause if the reactants are not supplied, the reaction ceases, andif the products are not distributed but instead accumulate near the site ofreaction,LeChatelier'sPrinciple of chemical reactions operates to drive thereversible reaction backward, diminishing the concentration of the products. Thus, in order to maintain a chemical reaction, the re-actants mustbe continuously supplied and the products must move through the cellmedium to other sites. Diffu-sion is how these processes occur. When a certain chemical reaction is operating in the cell, some reactingsubstance will be used up. The concen-tration of this substance is necessarilylower in regions closer to the site of reaction than regions fartheraway from it. Under this condition, a concentration gradient is established. The concentration gradient causes the movement of moleculesof this substance from a region of higher concentration to a regionof lower concentration, or the reaction site. This movement is called diffusion. Thus, by diffusion, molecules tend to move to regions in the cell wherethey are being consumed. The products of the reaction travel away fromthe reaction site also by this process of diffusion. At the reaction site, thecon-centration of the products is highest, hence the products tend to moveaway from this region to ones where they are lower in concentration. The removal of products signals the reaction to keep on going. When the productconcen-tration gets too high, the reaction is inhibited by a built-in feedbackmechanism. Thus diffusion explains how movement of chemical sub-stances occursinto or out of the cell and within the cell. For example, oxygen moleculesare directed by a concentra-tion gradient to enter the cell and movetoward the mitochondria. This is because oxygen concentration is nec-essarilythe lowest in the mitochondria where oxidation reactions continuallyconsume oxygen. Carbon dioxide is produced when an acetyl unitis completely oxidized in the citric acid cycle. The CO_2 will then travel awayfrom the mitochondria, where it is produced, to other parts of the cell, or out of the cell into the bloodstream where it is lower in concentration.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F02-0059.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Diffusion is important to the movement of materials in living cells because it allows for the continuous supply of reactants and distribution of products, maintaining chemical reactions and life processes."}

{"question": "The sulfate ion consists of a central sulfur atom with four equivalent oxygen atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement. Keeping in mind the octet rule, draw the electronic struc-ture for the ion. What should the internal O-S-O bond angle be?", "solution": "The formula for the sulfate ion is SO_4^=. To write the electronic structure of the ion in this problem, one must consider the definition of valence and the octet rule. Valence electrons refer to those outer electrons that participate in chemical bonding. The octet rule states that for stability, there can be no more than eight electrons in the outer orbit of an atom, either as a result of transfer or sharing. Thus, after determining the number of valence electrons present, arrange them so that they obey the octet rule. The electronic configuration of sulfur is 1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^4. It has 6 valence electrons; they are found in the 3s and 3p orbitals. The electronic con-figuration of oxygen is 1s^22s^22p^4, which means it also has six valence electrons; the first orbital contains only 2 electrons. The electronic structure of each of these atoms can be represented as shown in figure a and figure b, where x's and dots indicate valence electrons. The electronic structure of the ion can be pictured as figure c. Here, one can see that the sulfur and two of the oxygen atoms are surrounded by eight electrons. Because two of the oxygen atoms are only surrounded by seven electrons, each of these atoms possesses a negative charge. This structure may also be drawn as shown in figure d. For greatest stability the oxygen atoms must take positions as far apart as possible. It has been shown that when four atoms surround a fifth the most stable arrangement is tetrahedral.

{"question": "Why is the flexor muscle of the crayfish well developed?", "solution": "In order to answer this question, it is ne-cessary to understand the body plan of the crayfish. (Refer to figure in last solution.) Crustaceans have a head and trunk which is usually composed of a thorax and abdomen. The head and thoracic segments of the decapods are fused together dorsally by a carapace, which hangs over the sides of the animal and encloses the gills. Lobsters and crayfish have a large segmented abdomen, with appendages on each segment. The fourth thoracic appendages are chelipeds, walking legs that function as claws. The next four pairs of thoracic appendages are smaller, thinner walking legs. Lobsters, crayfish, and burrowing shrimps generally crawl with these walking legs. These animals are also capable of swimming backward rapidly. This is accomplished by flexing the abdomen ventrally. The flexor muscle of the crayfish is well-developed and powerful. It enables the animal to flex its abdomen rapidly in swimming. Many non-swimming decapods have a greatly reduced abdomen that is folded up under the thorax. This is often the case in crabs, as most crabs cannot swim. The blue crab, however, is a powerful and agile swimmer. Its last pair of legs are broad flat paddles that act as propellers. Shrimps are generally bottom-dwellers, i.e., they dwell at the bottom of a body of water. They swim intermittently. The abdominal appendages, pleopods, are the principal swimming organs. The pleopods are large and often fringed. Shrimps utilize ventral flexion of the abdomen for quick backward darts and for vertical steering.", "images": ["images/F12-0307_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F12-0307.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "It enables the animal to flex its abdomen rapidly in swimming."}

The vapor pressure of pure water is 4.6 mm and 760 mm at 0\\textdegreeC and 100\\textdegreeC, respectively and the K_f. = (1.86 C / mole) and K_b = (.52 C / mole).", "solution": "To solve (a), you must employ Raoult's law, which states P_H(2)O= P\\textdegree_H(2)O X_H(2)O, where P_H(2)O = the partial pressure of water (the solvent). P\\textdegree_H(2)O = the vapor pressure of water when pure, and X_H(2)O is the mole fraction of H_2O in the solution. The mole fraction is equal to (N_H(2)O) / [(N_solute) + (N_H(2)O)],where N_H(2)O = moles of H_2O, and N_solute = mole of solute.You are told the P\\textdegree_H(2)O for H_2O at the temperatures in question. Thus, to find the vapor pressures of the solution, you must calculate X_H(2)O and substitute into Raoult's law. To calculate the concentration of urea, remember moles = (grams) / (molecular weight). Since you have 300 grams of urea and the molecular weight of urea is 60.06 g, you have (300 / 60.06) or 4.995 moles of urea. Similarly, for water (MW = 18). you have (1000 g) / [(18 g / mole)] = 55.55 moles of water. Thus, the mole fraction of water = (55.55)/(4.995 + 55.55) = .917. Therefore, at 0\\textdegree, [P_H(2)O = P\\textdegree_H(2)O X_H(2)O = (4.6 mm)(.917) = 4.2 mm]at 760\\textdegree, [P_H(2)O = P\\textdegree_H(2)O X_H(2)O = (760)(.917) = 697 mm].

If you find \u2206T_f, you can calculate the freezing point, since the normal freezing point is decreased by this amount to give you the new freezing point. Boiling point works in the same way, except that you add to the normal boiling point. To calculate \u2206T_f and \u2206T_b, you must know molality. Molality = moles solvent per 1 kilogram solvent. You have 4.995 moles of urea and 1000 g of water or solvent, so that (4.995 mole) / (1 kg) \\approx 5molal solution, Thus, \u2206T_f = (1.86)(5) = 9.3\\textdegreeC and \u2206T_b = (.52)(5) = 2.6\\textdegreeC.

{"question": "What is a resting potential? Describe the chemical mechanism responsible for the resting potential. How can a resting potential be detected?", "solution": "There is a difference in electrical potential between the inside and the outside of all living cells. For example, the potential difference across the plasma membrane of the neuron is measured to be about 60 milli-volts, the inside being negative with respect to the outside. This potential difference is called the resting potential. The chemical basis for the resting potential is as follows (refer to Figure). By active transport, an energy- requiring process that transfers substances across the plasma membrane against their concentration gradients, the concentration of potassium (K^+) ions is kept higher inside the cell than outside. At the same time there is a lower concentration of sodium (Na^+) ions in the cell interior than the exterior. Moreover, in the resting state the permeability of the plasma membrane is different to K+ and Na^+ ions. The membrane is more permeable to K^+ ions than to Na^+ ions. Hence, K^+ ions can move across the membrane by simple diffusion to the outside more easily than Na^+ ions can move in to replace them. Because more positive charges (K^+) leave the inside of the cell than are replenished (by Na^+), there is a net negative charge on the inside and a net positive charge on the outside. An electrical potential is established across the membrane. This potential is the resting membrane potential. We can measure the resting potential by placing one electrode, insulated except at the tip, inside the cell and a second electrode on the outside surface and con-necting the two with a suitable recording device such as a sensitive galvanometer. The reading on the galvanometer should be approximately 60 millivolts if the cell tested is a neuron. (Different types of cells, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, vary in their values of resting potential.) Note, however, that if both electrodes are placed on the outside surface of the cell, no potential dif-ference between them is registered because all points on the outside are at equal potential. The same is true if both electrodes are placed on the inside surface of the plasma membrane.", "images": ["images/F20-0522_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F20-0522.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The resting potential is a difference in electrical potential between the inside and the outside of all living cells, with the inside being negative with respect to the outside.

{"question": "Name each of the organic compounds shown in figure A below.", "solution": "A system of nomenclature called the IUPAC system has been formulated so that all organic molecules may have their structures defined adequately. In this system for hydrocarbons (i.e. compounds containing only hydrogen and carbon atoms) the longest chain is taken as the basic structure, and the carbon atoms are numbered from the end of the chain closest to a branch chain or other modification of simple alkane structure. The position of substituents in the chain are denoted by the number of carbon atom or atoms to which they are attached. In the problem, you are not given alkanes, you are given alkenes, compounds that contain a double bond between a pair of carbon atoms (i.e. unsaturated), and a ring compound. In unsaturated compounds, the rules are the same, except that the position of the double bond is indicated; the numbering starts at the end of the chain nearest the double bond. For rings, name the ring and any substituent present based on which carbon is located. Thus, you proceed as follows: (a) There is only one chain, and it possesses three carbon atoms. The double bond is located on the first carbon, not the second, since you want to use the lowest possible number. As such, you form the molecule propene. Three carbons suggest propane. It's an alkene, so that you change ane to ene. Therefore, propane becomes propene. You have no need to name the position of the double bond here; the double bond can only be in two po-sitions and both yield the same molecule. That is,CH2 = CH - CH_3 is equivalent to CH_3 - CH = CH_2. = CH - CH_3 is equivalent to CH_3 - CH = CH_2. (b) The longest chain containing the double bond has 7 carbon atoms, so that \"hep\" prefix is suggested. Because it is a double bond, you add the suffix ene to obtain heptene. The double bond is located on the second carbon, not the third, since you want the lowest number. You have, therefore, the 2-heptene. Using this numbering system, you see that CH_3, a methyl group, is located on the fifth carbon. Thus, the name of the molecule is 5-metyl 2 heptene. (c) Has a six carbon chain, which suggests the pre-fix ''hex\\textquotedblright. There is a double bond so that the molecule has the suffix ene. Thus, you obtain hexene.

This means that when strong acids are dissolved the equilibrium will be shifted far to the right in water, but not as far in acetic acid. Thus, more products will be produced in the water solution than in the acetic acid. The acidities of the 3 given acids depend upon how much H^+ ion they produce. If the equilibrium is not shifted to the right, less H^+ ion is being produced. Thus, theacidicitiesof the three given acids will be less in acetic acid, since the equi-librium is shifted less to the right, and thus, not much H^+ ion is generated. (b) The leveling effect can also be thought of in terms ofbasicity. For the two types of bases, you have B + H_2O \\rightleftarrows BH^+ + OH^- in water and B + CH_3COOH \\rightleftarrows BH^+ +CH_3COO^- in acetic acid. Now OH^- is a stronger base than CH_3COO^-, and, therefore, the equilibrium is further to the left in water than in acetic acid. Thus, when a base is added to water it will ionize less than in acetic acid.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Chemistry/E10-0333.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The leveling effect refers to the phenomenon where strong acids show distinct differences in acidities when dissolved in different solvents.

{"question": "How can glycogen (a polymer of glucose) be converted into fats (triacylglycerals) in the body?", "solution": "A fat, or triacylglycerol molecule, consists of glycerol bonded to three fatty acids. Therefore, in order for glycogen to be converted into fats, it must first be broken down and converted into glycerol or an activated form of glycerol and fatty acids. Glycogen is broken down by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase, to give glucose 1-phosphate (G1P). G1P is next converted to glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) by the enzyme phosphoglucomutase. G6P is then isomerized to fructose 6-phosphate by an isomerase enzyme. Further reaction of fructose 6-phosphate result in the formation of two triose phosphates: dihydroxy- acetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. At this point, the conversion branches. Dihydroxyacetone-P (where P indicates phosphate) is reduced to glycerol 3-P which then gets hydrolyzed by a phosphatase to glycerol. Glyceraldehyde 3-P is converted to pyruvate by a series of reactions. Pyruvate now undergoes oxidative decarboxylation in the mitochondria and is activated by Coenzyme A to become acetyl-CoA. The latter enters the citric acid cycle where it combines with oxaloacetate to form citrate. Citrate, unlike acetyl-CoA, can pass through the mitochond-rial membrane to the cytoplasm, where it is reconverted to acetyl-CoA. Acetyl- CoA is then converted in the cytoplasm into malonyl-CoA, and finally, via a complex sequence of reactions, into fatty acids. Three fatty acids then react with one glycerol molecule to form a triacylglycerol. This sequence of events, discussed only briefly above, is summarized below: Note that pyruvate can only be converted to acetyl-CoA in the Note that pyruvate can only be converted to acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria. Fatty acids, however, are synthesized in the cytoplasm. Since acetyl-CoA cannot directly leave the mitochondria, it must first be converted to citrate, which can leave the mitochondria, and then be reconverted to acetyl-CoA in the cytoplasm. Although the enzymes for each reaction step are not indicated, it is important to realize that each step is catalyzed by an enzyme or complex of enzymes.", "images": ["images/F03-0093_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F03-0093.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Glycogen is broken down and converted into glycerol or an activated form of glycerol and fatty acids.

{"question": "When light is incident on a thin slit, a diffraction pattern, shown in figure (a), is produced. Find an expression which give the location of the minima of diffraction pattern in terms of the angle \\psi.(see figure (b)).", "solution": "In this problem, we consider only Fraunhoferdiffraction. (See figure (b).) This type of diffraction is characterized by parallel, incident light rays encountering a slit, and being diffracted, again parallel to one another. In practice, this restriction may be effected in 2 ways. The light source is placed very far away from the slit, and the screen is far from the slit. Another method employs a converging lens to the left of the slit, and a converging lens to the right. Light rays incident upon the first converging lens leave par-allel to one another, encounter the slit, and are diffracted parallel to one another (see figure (c)). They then are focused by the second con-verging lens on screen F, and the diffraction pattern results. Using figure (c), we can derive an equation locating the minima of the diffraction pattern. Let us focus on rays coming from points A and B. Since the incident light is in phase, the only phase differencebetween r_1 and r_2 must occur because r_2 travels a larger distance r_1. (Here, we assume that the rays are effectively parallel). If this distance, BB', is equal to (1/2) \\lambda, where \\lambda is the wavelength of light, the rays r_1 and r_2 will interfere destructively and p_1 will be a minimum. Since BB' = a/2 sin \\psi, minima will be observed when a/2 sin \\psi = \\lambda/2 Hence, a sin \\psi = \\lambdaminima. This formula gives the 1st order minima of the diffraction pattern. Now, examine figure (d), where the slit has been divided into 4 equal portions of length a/4. Looking at rays r_1, and r_2, we note that the only phase difference between them occurs because they travel unequal distances. Ray r_2 travels a distance BB' greater than r_1. If BB' = \\lambda/2, r1and r_2 will destructively interfere. Furthermore, r_3 and r_4 will also destructively interfere since DH = \\lambda/2. Hence, each pair of similar rays will destructively interfere, and p_2 will be a minimum of the diffraction pattern. Therefore, since BB' = a/4 sin \\psi the second order minimum is described by Thena/4 sin \\psi = \\lambda/2minimum a sin \\psi = 2\\lambdaminimum.

When monomers join to form a polymer, the last monomer is left unreacted at the end of the chain.

{"question": "Explain how a \"Skinner box\" can be used in operant conditioning.", "solution": "In operant conditioning, a particular behavior is rewarded or punishedwhen it occurs, thereby increasing or decreasing the probability thatit will occur again. The Skinner box (named after B. F. Skinner, a behavioralpsychologist) is a principal means of studying this type of learning. The typical Skinner box is a small cage with a bar and food dish. When a rat or other small animal is placed in the box, its exploratorybehavior might cause it to press the bar accidentally. If the rat isrewarded by being given a food pellet, it is more probable that it will pressthe bar again. This is called positive reinforce-ment. It is critical that thereward be given within a second or so after the response in order for conditioningto be affective. The reward is given whenever the rat presses thebar. The rat eventually learns to associate bar-pressing with food. Repetition produces a degree of learning beyond which there is no improvement. One can eliminate the bar pressing behavior by eliminating the reinforcement. This is called extinction, which is the decay of the original learnedbehavior in the absence of the reward.Therateof extinction dependson the extent and schedule of positive reinforcement. In-creased repetitionmakes a response more resistant to extinction. Also, reinforcementat temporal intervals (giving a reward for every fourth bar press) is more difficult to extinguish than continuous reinforcement (rewardfor every bar press).

{"question": "How does asexual reproduction in plants differ from sexual reproduction? What are the evolutionary advantages of the latter?", "solution": "Asexual reproduction in plants takes place by the separation of any portion, or specialized portion, of a parent plant to form new individuals, or by the for-mation and germination of spores or single cells specialized in the replication of new individuals. Both these methods preserve the genetic makeup of the parent plants. Sexual reproduction involves the union of two gametes. The combination of two different sets of chromosomes from the gametes results in a new individual with a new genetic composition. Sexual reproduction therefore gives rise to new genotypes while asexual reproduction perpetuates the same ones. Sexual reproduction is an important process in the evolution of a species, and is considered much more ad-vantageous than asexual reproduction. The fusion of gametes from two genetically different parents makes possible new combinations of genetic material and thus increases the variation among individuals in the population. Genetic variation provides a pool of diversified phenotypes upon which natural selection can act. By this process, natural forces determine which individuals of the species will survive and which will become extinct, ultimately improving the species by sorting out the advantageous gene in the pool. An asexually reproducing species offers little genetic variation for selection and evolution is minimized. In addition, the natural forces acting upon any species are always changing. The more a species is able to respond to these forces with evolutionary changes that maintain or increase its fitness, the more likely it is to survive and multiply. Such evolutionary changes can occur through genetic mutations, expressed in phenotypes which are then acted upon by natural selection. Because a mutated gene is usually recessive, sexual reproduction increases its chance of expression by bringing two mutated alleles together in the process ofgameticfusion. Asexual reproduction will need a double mutation, which occurs in the order of 10^-12 per generation, to result in an altered phenotype. Therefore, without sexual reproduction there could be little genotypic and thus phenotypic changes. Evolution could not progress, as there could be no response to inevitable environmental changes, and extinction of the species would soon follow.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F09-0209.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Asexual reproduction in plants preserves the genetic makeup of the parent plants, while sexual reproduction gives rise to new genotypes.

{"question": "On being heated in air, a mixture ofFeOand Fe_3O_4 picks up oxygen so as to be converted completely to Fe_3O_4. If the observed weight gain is 5.00 percent of the initial weight, what must have been the composition of the initial mixture?", "solution": "One should first determine the weight percent increase when the mixture is 100 %FeOor 100 % Fe_3O_4. 5.0 % increase will be some mixture in between. 5 % will be equal to the sum of the products of the percent weight gained by each compound and the fractions of the mixture that each compound contributes. The reaction ofFeOand O to form Fe_2O_3 is 2FeO + 1/2 O_2 \\ding{217} Fe_2O_3 . The percent weight increase for the reaction is found by dividing the weight of Fe_2O_3 by the weight of 2FeO. Weight of 2FeO is 144, weight of Fe_2O_3 is 160. (weight of Fe_3O_4) / (weight of 2FeO) = 160 / 144 = 1.1111 The percent weight increase is equal to (1.1111 - 1.0) \u00d7 100 = 11.11 %. This means that for each Fe_2O_3 formed byFeOthere is an 11.11 % weight increase. One can solve for the weight increase for Fe_3O_4 by a similar method. The reaction is 2 Fe_3O_4 + 1/2 O_2 + 3 Fe_2O3 The weight of 2 Fe_3O_4, is 464, the weight of 3Fe_3O_4 is 480.

{"question": "How do we know that ATP is generated at three sites in the electron transport chain? What is the advantage of having a sequential transfer of electrons rather than one single transfer?", "solution": "The NADH and FADH2 formed in glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation and the citric acid (TCA) cycle are energy-rich molecules. When each of these molecules transfers its pair of electrons to molecular oxygen, a large amount of energy is released. This released energy can be used to generate ATP in oxidative phosphorylation. As electrons flow through the electron transport chain from NADH to O2, ATP is formed at three sites along the chain. How do we know that three separate sites exist instead of one site where 3 ATP are produced? The first evidence is the ATP yield from the oxidation of different substrates. The oxidation of NADH yields 3 ATP but the oxidation of succinate, which forms FADH2, only yields 2 ATP. The electrons from FADH2 enter the chain at coenzyme Q, which is past the first phosphory-lation site. Only 1 ATP is formed when ascorbate (an artificial substrate also called Vitamin C) is oxidized, since its electrons enter at cytochrome c, which is past the first two phosphorylation sites. The P:O ratio (the ratio of organically bound phosphorous produced per mole of oxygen, which is often used as an index of oxida-tive phosphorylation) is 3:2:1 for NADH : succinate : ascorbate, respectively. Hence, by knowing the P:O ratios and that each substrate enters the process at different steps,we see that one mole of ATP is produced at each site. The steps involved can be determined by the free energy change, \u2206G, released during electron transfer. The \u2206G for electron transfer from NADH to FMN is -12 kcal/mole, from cytochrome b to c, -10 kcal/mole, and from cytochrome a to O2, -24 kcal/mole. These reactions are sufficiently exergonic to drive the synthesis of ATP, whereas the other electron transfer reactions do not release sufficient energy to allow ATP synthesis to take place. There also exist inhibitors which specifically block certain steps in the chain. Rotenone specifically inhibits electron transfer from NADH to coenzyme Q, pre-venting ATP synthesis at the first site. Antimycin A inhibits electron flow at the second site, while cyanide and carbon monoxide block electron transfer at the third site. Each inhibitor has been observed to block all successive steps of the electron transport system. However it is possible to bypass the action of the inhi-bitor. For instance, the action of rotenone can be avoided through the addition of either succinate or ascorbate. Similarly, the action of antimycin A on the second site can be bypassed through the addition of ascorbate. By inhibiting the various sites and measuring the resulting P:O ratios it can be deduced that each site in the electron transport chain is responsible for the production of one molecule of ATP (see figure). It should be noted that the addition of antimycin A will result in the blockage of site 1 as well as site 2. This is due to a backflow of electrons which results in the reduction of site 1, thus inactivating it. Likewise, the addition of cyanide results in the reduction of sites 1 and 2 as well as 3, thus rendering them all incapable of ATP formation. Hence cyanide has the well deserved reputation as one of the world's strongest toxins. The advantage of the sequential transfer over one single transfer is that the sequential reactions divide up the free energy change of the oxidation of NADH, which is highly exergonic. The free energy of oxidation of NADH + (1/2) O2 + H+ \\rightleftharpoons H2O + NAD+ is about - 53 kcal/mole. If all this energy were released at once, much of it would be wasted as heat since only 7 kcal are needed to phosphorylate ADP to form ATP. If all the energy from the oxidation of NADH is released at once to form 1 ATP, the efficiency of this system is 7/53 \u00d7 100% = 13%. However, if the same energy is released in a stepwise process to form 3 ATP, the efficiency is 21/53 \u00d7 100% = 40%. Thus, stepwise reactions increase the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation from 13% to 40%. In addition, the large amount of heat liberated would very easily destroy enzyme activity and thus is harmful to the cell if released in one burst. The three reactions involved are \"coupled\" with the phosphorylation of ADP so that the liberated energy is used immediately to drive this otherwise non-spontane- ous reaction. The exact mechanism of oxidative phosphorylation, that is, how the energy liberated is transferred so as to form the high energy phosphate bond of ATP, is un-known. The exact mechanism of oxidative phosphorylation, that is, how the energy liberated is transferred as so to form the high energy phosphate bond of ATP, is unknown. Mitchell proposed a chemiosmotic hypothesis in 1961. The three sites of \"ATP synthesis\" along the respiratory chain are actually sites where, at each, a pair of protons (2 H+) are pumped from the matrix to the intermembrane space. This creates a proton gradient. The protons flow back onto the matrix through special \"lollypop\" enzymes. As a pair of H+ flow back in down the proton gradient, one ATP is synthe-sized. Three pairs of H+ are extruded into the intermem-brane space per NADH, so three pairs of H+ can re-enter and thus produce 3 ATPs. The mechanisms is similar for FADH2, except since FADH2 donates their electrons at the second site, only two pairs reenter and two ATPs are synthesized.", "images": ["images/F03-0090_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F03-0090.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "ATP is generated at three sites in the electron transport chain as evidenced by the ATP yield from the oxidation of different substrates and the P:O ratios.

{"question": "Explain the four important evolutionary events that occurred inthe Paleozoic Era.", "solution": "The Paleozoic Era was marked by four important evolutionary events.

The first land plantsappeared, signifying the beginning of the invasion of the land by plants. These plants most closely resembled the ferns. At about the same time, the first air-breathing animals arose. These were thearachnids- landdwellers resembling to some extent modern scorpions. Finally, in the Carboniferous Period, the first reptiles, called the stem reptiles, appeared. This was an important evolutionary event because the stem reptiles were thecommon primal ancestors of a great variety of animals that still exist today. The modern reptiles, birds, and mammals are all derivatives of the stem reptiles.", "images": [], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F28-0735.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "The four important evolutionary events are: appearance of ancestral backbone-bearing animals, appearance of first land plants, emergence of first air-breathing animals, and appearance of first reptiles."}
{"question": "A 1-gram block rests on a frictionless surface and we measure the position of the block to a precision of 0.1 mm. What velocity have we imparted to the block by the act of measuring its position?", "solution": "If we try to determine the position of a particle at a point x_0 along the x axis as shown in the figure we find that our measurement of the position x_0 cannot be made as precise as required (assuming that it is at rest). As we try to confine the particle to a more exact position, we become less certain about whether it really is at rest at that position. This is a consequence of quantum mechanics and is known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. If the uncer-tainty involved in the measurement of position is \\Deltax, then the antic-ipated uncertainty in the momentum of the particle will be such that \\Deltax \\Deltap_x \\approx h where h is Planck's constant. Since p_x = mv_x , we have \\Deltax m\\Deltav_x \\approx h or \\Deltav_x \\approx (h/m \\Deltax) = [(6.6 \u00d7 10^-27 erg-sec) / {(1 g) \u00d7 (10^-2 cm)}] = 6.6 \u00d7 10^-25 cm/sec This velocity is so small that we must consider the block to be still \"at rest\". The implications of the uncertainty principle for macro-scopic objects are unimportant, but for microscopic objects they are crucial. That there is any uncertainty at all in the measurement arises from the fact that we can see the block only by virtue of the scatter-ing of photons from the block and this process imparts momentum to the block.", "images": ["images/D33-0980_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Physics/D33-0980.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": true, "answer": "6.6 \u00d7 10^-25 cm/sec"}
{"question": "Bone, like other connective tissues, consists of cells and fibers, but unlike the others its extracellular components are calcified, making it a hard, unyielding substance ideally suited for its supportive and protective function in the skeleton. Describe the macroscopic and microscopic structure of bone.", "solution": "Upon inspection of a long bone with the naked eye, two forms of bone are distinguishable: cancellous (spongy) and compact. Spongy bone consists of a network of hardened bars having spaces between them filled with marrow. Compact bone appears as a solid, continuous mass, in which spaces can be seen only with the aid of a microscope. The two forms of bone grade into one another without a sharp boundary. (See Fig.1.) In typical long bones, such as the femur or humerus, the shaft (diaphysis) consists of compact bone surrounding a large central marrow cavity composed of spongy bone. In adults, the marrow in the long bones is primarily of the yellow, fatty variety, while the marrow in the flat bones of the ribs and at the ends of long bones is primarily of the red variety and is active in the produc-tion of red blood cells. Even this red marrow contains about 70 percent fat. The ends (epiphyses) of long bones consist mainly of spongy bone covered by a thin layer of compact bone. This region of the long bones contains a cartilaginous region known as an epiphyseal plate. The epiphyseal cartilage and the adjacent spongy bone constitute a growth zone, in which all growth in length of the bone occurs. The surfaces at the ends of long bones, where one bone articulates with another are covered by a layer of cartilage, called the articular cartilage. It is this cartilage which allows for easy movement of the bones over each other at a joint. Compact bone is composed of structural units called Haversian systems. Each system is irregularly cylindrical and is composed of concentrically arranged layers of hard, inorganic matrix surrounding a microscopic central Haversian canal. Blood vessels and nerves pass through this canal, supplying and controlling the metabolism of the bone cells. The bone matrix itself is laid down by bone cells called osteoblasts. Osteoblasts produce a substance, osteoid, which is hardened by calcium, causing calcification. Some osteoblasts are trapped in the hardening osteoid and are converted into osteocytes which continue to live within the bone. These osteocytes lie in small cavities called lacunae', located along the interfaces between adjoining concentric layers of 'the hard matrix. Exchange of materials between the bone cells and the blood vessels in the Haversian canals is by way of radiating canals. Other canals, known as Volkmann's canals, penetrate and cross the layers of hard matrix, connecting the different Haversian canals to one another. (See Fig. 2.) With few exceptions, bones are invested by the periosteum, a layer of specialized connective tissue. The periosteum has the ability to form bone, and contri-butes to the healing of fractures. Periosteum is lacking on those ends of long bones surrounded by articular cartilage. The marrow cavity of the diaphysis and the cavities of spongy bone are lined by the endosteum, a thin cellular layer which also has the ability to form bone (osteogenic potencies). Haversian type systems are present in most compact bone. However, certain compact flat bones of the skull (the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal bones, and part of the mandible) do not have Haversian systems. These bones, termed membrane bones, have a different architecture and are formed differently than bones with Haversian systems.", "images": ["images/F19-0477_files/image002.jpg"], "html_file": "/Users/wenhuchen/Documents/Crawler/Biology/F19-0477.htm", "image_question": false, "image_answer": false, "short_answer": false, "answer": "Bone consists of two forms: cancellous (spongy) and compact.
